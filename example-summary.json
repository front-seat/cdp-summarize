The proposed ordinance would make public use or possession of controlled substances a gross misdemeanor and prioritize diversion and connecting individuals with recovery services. The meeting covered topics such as insensitive messaging in body cam footage, harm reduction, racial disparities in diversion decisions, drug-free zones, the impact of crime and homelessness, and investment in programs supporting individuals affected by drugs. Opinions on the proposed legislation varied, with some supporting it for public safety reasons and others opposing it due to concerns about its potential negative impact on marginalized communities and lack of resources for treatment and diversion programs. The council also discussed a bill regarding data collection, with amendments proposed to address concerns about biased policing and officer discretion.

        "text": "Amendment 3 proposes adding recitals to address the LEAD program's capacity for pre-booking diversion for individuals possessing and using controlled substances in public places. The amendment raises concerns about potential negative impacts on access to LEAD services for individuals not connected to law enforcement referrals. The City's contract with PDA to support the LEAD diversion model is for $9.9 million, but additional funding estimates are not available. The amendment could potentially limit access to LEAD services for individuals with behavioral issues, extreme poverty, and income instability.\n\nThis text discusses Amendment 1 Version 1 to CB 120645, which addresses the opioid crisis and makes changes to public safety and health response. The amendment includes changes such as acknowledging the limitations of diversion, clarifying the use of diversion instead of arrest, and establishing a behavioral health advisory committee. The text also discusses guidelines for officer decision-making and the use of force, emphasizing the preference for diversion, treatment, and alternatives to booking. A report will be produced twice a year on individuals referred to diversion, including demographic information.\n\nAmendment 4 to CB 120645 expands the Deferred Prosecution program in Seattle Municipal Court to include offenses related to substance use and mental health disorders. It provides guidance to judges on procedures and treatment program terms, and emphasizes outreach to individuals affected by drug use. The amendment also includes specific sections and excludes cannabis from certain definitions. It provides guidance for the application of chapter 10.05 RCW to misdemeanors and gross misdemeanors, with provisions for deferred prosecution and dismissal of cases upon successful completion of the program.\n\nThis amendment changes the requirement for officers to intervene when an individual is a harm to themselves from mandatory to discretionary. It also removes the requirement for officers to contact diversion or outreach services before making an arrest. Additionally, the amendment removes the need for additional facts and circumstances to justify an arrest.\n\nThe text discusses a proposed bill in Seattle that aims to guide the police department in responding to drug possession and use. The bill emphasizes diversion and referral to services rather than arrests. The Mayor's Office plans to issue an Executive Order to inform police policies on this matter. The text also discusses the LEAD program, its funding, and capacity challenges. It mentions the costs and considerations of expanding the program, including the need for office spaces, participant support, and housing. State and federal funding options are also mentioned.\n\nAmendment 2 in Seattle proposes adding the crimes of knowing possession and use of a controlled substance in a public place. The amendment requires the Seattle Police Department to define the \"Threat of harm to others\" in their policies regarding drug use and possession. If the identified factors rise to a level that would constitute \"Likelihood of Serious harm,\" the officer would take the individual into custody for a behavioral health evaluation. The amendment clarifies that the threat of harm does not include the mere use of drugs in public without other identifiable factors.\n\nAmendment 1 Version 2 to CB 120645 proposes changes to the public safety and health response to the opioid crisis in Seattle. The amendment includes provisions such as acknowledging the limitations of diversion, clarifying the use of diversion instead of arrest, and establishing a behavioral health advisory committee. It also outlines guidelines for police officers when dealing with individuals who pose a threat of harm to themselves due to drug possession or use. The amendment aims to increase public safety and provide guidance to police officers enforcing specific crimes.\n\nAmendment 5 Version 1 to CB 120645 proposes reporting requirements and data collection to evaluate the impact of policy guidance on police officers' ability to do their job. The amendment acknowledges the reclassification of drug offenses, the city's commitment to coordinating with King County, and the mayor's plan to invest in addressing the opioid crisis. It emphasizes the disproportionate impact of drug offense laws on communities of color and the need for an independent review. The amendment includes reporting requirements for officers when making arrests and outlines the data that needs to be collected on drug-related incidents. The Office of Inspector General will provide recommendations based on their review of the data. The text also outlines information that needs to be included in a review of a specific section related to public safety and human services.\n\nAmendment 6 Version 1 to CB 120645 suggests changing the language in an ordinance related to assessing the threat of harm by officers in cases of public use or possession of controlled substances. The amendment would give officers discretion in determining whether to assess the threat of harm by changing the wording from \"will\" to \"may.\" This amendment is contingent upon the passage of another amendment, Amendment 1/sponsor substitute.\n\nThe City of Seattle is proposing an ordinance that would make the use or possession of controlled substances in public a gross misdemeanor. The legislation prioritizes diversion and connecting individuals with recovery services rather than arrest. It may result in increased criminal charges and the need for additional resources. There are no financial impacts mentioned if the legislation is not implemented.",

The City\u2019s contract for LEAD services explicitly prioritizes referrals to\nLEAD by law enforcement, including pre-arrest diversion and social contact diversion. However,\nduring the first half of 2023 only three percent of all referrals were from arrest diversion, and\nan additional 25 percent were from social contact, and the majority of referrals were initiated\nby community members. Significantly more referrals from law enforcement could crowd out\nthe program\u2019s ability to accept referrals from community members or create an environment\nin which police officers are the de facto gatekeepers for access to LEAD programs and services.\nThe City\u2019s 2023 contract with PDA to support the LEAD diversion model is for $9.9 million. With\nthese resources, the PDA had 752 active LEAD clients at the end of June. It was not possible to\ndevelop an estimate of the additional funding that would be required to fund LEAD to scale. As\na point of reference, a September 2021 Central Staff memo to the PSHS Committee estimated\nthe need for $21 million in 2022 and $30 million in 2023 to fund all \u201cpriority qualifying\nreferrals\u201d to LEAD, which the memo defines as \u201cindividuals who engage in criminal activity\nrelated to behavioral health issues, substance use, and/or extreme poverty or income\ninstability.\u201d If policies were developed to prioritize such referrals for enrollment in LEAD, one\neffect could be to curtail access to program services for individuals connected to LEAD mainly\nDoss\nPublic Safety and Human Services\nSeptember 12, 2023\nD1\nor solely because of behavioral issues, extreme poverty, and/or income instability. Information\nis not available on the proportion of LEAD clients who were connected with the program\nmainly or solely due to public use of unprescribed or illegal controlled substances.\n1.

Add in subsection 3.28.141.G.2 that officers are exempt from complying with the\nrequirement that they make a reasonable attempt to contact and coordinate efforts for\ndiversion, outreach, or other alternatives to arrest when the appropriate or most viable\ncare strategy appears to be transport to a diversion point of contact, a medical care\nfacility, a crisis care center, or a diversion facility;\n8.

Consistent with any public health and safety-related Mayor-issued executive\norders, the Seattle Police Department (SPD) will adopt policies governing arrests for the crimes\ndescribed in subsection 3.28.141.A ((public use and possession of a controlled substance)).\nThese new policies will seek to minimize use of force and incorporate de-escalation and crisis\nintervention that reflect existing SPD policies in those areas.

When considering making an arrest, releasing, or diverting\nan individual, pursuant to subsection 3.28.141.E, ((for knowing possession or public use,))\nofficers will determine whether the individual, through their actions and conduct, presents a\nthreat of harm to others. This determination is based on the totality of the circumstances and the\nofficer\u2019s training and experience. SPD policy will identify factors to guide officers when\nassessing the threat of harm presented by the individual. The threat of harm assessment\n((standard)) governs officer decisionmaking and is not an element of the crime to be proved\nduring the prosecution of the crimes described in subsection 3.28.141.A ((possession or public\nuse offenses)) and cannot be used as a defense at trial.\nFG.

An officer will not arrest ((in this situation)) when the individual only poses a\nthreat of harm to self absent articulable facts and circumstances warranting such action and SPD\npolicies and/or training will identify what additional articulable facts and circumstances would\nwarrant arrest.\n4. ((A determination of a)) The threat of harm assessment will govern officer\ndecisionmaking and will not be an element of the crime to be proved during the prosecution of\nthe crimes described in subsection 3.28.141.A ((possession and public use)) and cannot be used\nas a defense at trial.\nGH. Officer safety. Nothing in this Section 3.28.141 is intended to compromise the safety\nor well-being of police officers.\nHI. Reporting.

Based on officer availability, location, and deployment limitations, SPD shall seek to\nprioritize use of officers who have received at least 40 hours of crisis intervention team (CIT)\ntraining when enforcing the crimes described in subsection 3.28.141.A.\nAdd a new Section 4 to CB 120645 and renumber subsequent sections:\nAsha Venkataraman\nPublic Safety and Human Services\nSeptember 12, 2023\nD1\nSection 4.

            "text": "August 16, 2023 (updated Aug 24, 2023)\nM E M O R A N D U M\nTo: Public Safety and Human Services Committee\nFrom: Asha Venkataraman, Greg Doss, Ann Gorman, Jennifer LaBrecque, Analysts\nSubject: CB 120645: Knowing possession or use in a public place of unprescribed or illegal\ncontrolled substances and associated policies\nOn September 12, 2023, the Public Safety and Human Services (PSHS) Committee will discuss and\npossibly vote on Council Bill (CB) 120645, co-sponsored by Councilmembers Herbold and Lewis. CB\n120645 would adopt by reference portions of second engrossed second substitute Senate bill 5536\n(2E2SSB 5536) to make a gross misdemeanor the knowing possession or use in a public place of\nunprescribed or illegal controlled substances. The legislation would also establish policies governing\narrests for these crimes. The Council previously considered CB 120586, which would have codified the\nadoption of the state law by reference but did not include any policies governing arrests. Please see the\nJune 1, 2023 Central Staff memo for further background on CB 120586 and issues that inform CB\n120645. This memo provides background, a description of the bill and associated funding, issues for the\ncommittee\u2019s consideration, and next steps.\nBackground\nFor discussion of the development of 2E2SSB 5536, please see the \u201cBackground\u201d section of the\nJune 1, 2023, Central Staff memo on CB 120586. In short, after a court decision struck down\nWashington State\u2019s felony possession law, a temporary measure made possession a simple\nmisdemeanor, and was then replaced by 2E2SSB 5536, which make knowing possession or use in a\npublic place of unprescribed or illegal controlled substances gross misdemeanors.\nOn April 17, 2023, Mayor Harrell issued Executive Order 2023-04 to address the opioid and synthetic\ndrug crisis in Seattle. On June 12, 2023, he launched the Fentanyl Systems Task Force to make\nrecommendations on substance use disorder diversion and treatment. The intent was for three sub-\ngroups to meet and discuss: alternatives to community court/therapeutic courts; diversion; and\ntreatment. To date, the courts subgroup has met several times, but the other subgroups have not.\nRelated Funding\nWhile announcing the plan to transmit CB 120645, the Mayor also announced his intent to invest $27\nmillion towards facilities, treatment, and services to address substance use disorder. No legislation has\nyet been transmitted appropriating this $27 million for the purposes described below.\nMayor Harrell\u2019s announcement included approximately $7 million in Community Development Block\nGrant (CDBG) funding. The $7 million is funding that was allocated for other purposes in prior years and\nhas gone unspent.1 The Executive will be transmitting an appropriations bill in September to\nconsolidate this funding into the Human Services Department (HSD), as funds were originally allocated\namong several departments. Concurrent with the appropriations bill, HSD will also be transmitting an\nupdated 5-Year Consolidated Plan, which governs use of CDBG and other federal funding; the plan will\ninclude a new policy priority related to addressing the needs of people impacted by mental health and\nsubstance abuse issues.\nAt the August 14 PSHS Committee meeting, Mayor\u2019s Office Special Projects Director Andrew Myerberg\nstated that the Executive intends to conduct a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to award the CDBG\nfunds consistent with the policy priority referenced above. The one-time CDBG funding would support\nfacilities that provide programs and services related to substance use. Ongoing funding would need to\nbe identified for the operational costs associated with these facilities.\nMayor Harrell\u2019s announcement also references the use of $20 million of the City\u2019s share of funding from\nState-negotiated resolutions with opioid distributors, producers, and manufacturers, which would\nresult in an annual allocation of about $1.1 million for at least the first seven years of a 17-year payout\nperiod.2,3 It is possible that ongoing investigations by the State Attorney General\u2019s Office will lead to the\nrecovery of additional resolutions and/or settlements, which will incrementally increase the funding\nthat will flow to the City. These revenues may be used for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD)\nand any co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD) or mental health conditions, through evidence-\nbased or evidence informed programs or strategies.\nIn addition, Ordinance 126876, the mid-year supplemental budget legislation, also includes $1 million\nof one-time funds for the HSD budget for a contract with Evergreen Treatment Services to support the\nexpansion of its Treatment in Motion (TIM) program, which services those with opioid use disorder\n2 In October 2022, Attorney General Ferguson announced a resolution requiring McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc., and\nAmerisourceBergen Drug Corp. to pay the State a total of $518 million. In June 2023 he announced a resolution requiring CVS, Walgreens,\nTeva, and Allergan to pay the State a total of $371.8 million. Half of resolution funding is directed to eligible Washington cities and\ncounties, per an Allocation Agreement.\n3 Central Staff estimate that net revenue to the City will be $24 million over a period of 17 years. From a settlement that is separate from\nthese two resolutions, Seattle will receive in excess of $1 million over a payout period to be determined. These figures were developed for\nthe purposes of this memo only and should not be used for planning purposes. The methodology for determining an actual figure is highly\ncomplex and currently opaque to Central Staff. Central Staff awaits the HSD document described in footnote 5, infra. Central Staff\nunderstand that King County will request ten percent of the City\u2019s net revenues to administer the Opioid Abatement Council established\nas an element of the State resolutions. An additional ten percent of net revenues may be dedicated to the administrative costs of a City\ndepartment or departments consistent with eligibility requirements.\nPage 2 of 10\nthrough a mobile medication unit, and $200,000 in one-time funds for the HSD budget for pre-filing\ndiversion contracts.\nCB 120645\nAdoption of 2E2SSB 5536 by reference\nFor discussion of the content of 2E2SSB 5536 to be adopted by reference, please see the \u201cState\nLegislation\u201d section of the June 1, 2023, Central Staff memo on CB 120586.\nPolicies governing arrests for public use and possession of controlled substances\nCB 120645 would direct the Seattle Police Department (SPD) to adopt policies governing arrests for\npublic use and knowing possession of a controlled substance. Among other things, these policies\nwould:\n\u2022 State that diversion and referral to services is the preferred response to possession and public\nuse while acknowledging that arrests are warranted in some situations;\n\u2022 Provide guidance on diversion and be consistent with any public health and safetyrelated\nguidance in a Mayor-issued Executive Order (discussed below);\n\u2022 Seek to minimize use of force and incorporate de-escalation and crisis intervention that reflect\nexisting SPD policies in those areas; and\n\u2022 Require SPD to report to the Council on data that it collects on the racial composition of those\nwho are arrested and diverted to community-based services prior to jail booking or referral for\nprosecution, and those who are booked and referred for prosecution.\nThe Mayor\u2019s Office has indicated that it will issue an Executive Order to inform future SPD policies that\nwill govern officer actions when encountering people who are using or possessing drugs in public.\nThese policies would provide officers with specific direction about how to determine whether a person,\nthrough their actions and conduct, presents a threat of harm to others. The SPD policy will serve as the\nbasis for actions that officers would take consistent with CB 120645 Sections E (threat of harm to\nothers) and Section F (threat of harm to self). These sections require that officers follow a specific\ncourse of action when they have established probable cause to arrest a person for possessing or using\ndrugs in public:\n1. Section E: Threat of harm to others: Officers must determine whether the person is a threat of\nharm to others. This determination will be guided by SPD policy (to be developed), the totality of\ncircumstances, and the officer\u2019s training and experience.\n2. Section F: Threat of harm to self: Officers must make a reasonable attempt to contact and\ncoordinate efforts for diversion, outreach, and other alternatives to arrest. If a person is not a\nthreat of harm to others, then officers will only arrest if they have identified additional articulable\nfacts and circumstances warranting arrest.\nPage 3 of 10\nThe bill requires officers who make arrests under the authority that would be granted in CB 120645 to\ncomplete an arrest report that includes the facts that establish probable cause, an assessment of the\nthreat presented by the individual engaged in knowing possession and public use of a controlled\nsubstance, and whether, and in what manner, arrest or diversion was considered or utilized. The bill\nalso notes that nothing in SMC 3.28.141 is intended to compromise the safety or well-being of police\nofficers. Finally, the bill indicates that the officer\u2019s determination of threat of harm will not be an\nelement of the crime to be proved during the prosecution of possession or public use offenses and\ncannot be used as a defense at trial.\nIssues\nAdoption of 2E2SSB 5536 by reference\nFor discussion of the issues associated with adopting portions of 2E2SSB 5536 by reference, please see\nthe \u201cAnalysis\u201d section of the June 1, 2023 Central Staff memo on CB 120586. The issues identified in\nthat section (prosecution, law enforcement, diversion, fiscal responsibility and impact, and racial equity\nimpacts) are all still relevant and applicable to CB 120645. Additional information and analysis regarding\nsome of those issues are described below, as the addition of policies governing arrest may affect these\nissues.\nPolicies governing arrests for public use and possession of controlled substances\nExisting state and local laws provide SPD officers with the discretion to make arrests when they have\nprobable cause to believe that a crime may have been committed. CB 120645 acknowledges that\nprobable cause is required for an arrest of knowing drug possession or use, and also modifies officer\ndiscretion by requiring additional considerations and actions:\n1. An officer will consider whether an individual presents \u201cthreat of harm to others;\u201d\n2. An officer will make a \u201creasonable attempt to contact and coordinate efforts for diversion,\noutreach and other alternatives to arrest\u201d when they have determined a person is not a threat of\nharm to others.\nNeither of the above changes would ultimately prevent an officer from making an arrest under the\nauthority that would be provided under CB 120645. If officers choose to arrest, officers must comply\nwith the reporting requirements in Section 3 of the bill (SMC 3.28.141.H), which includes adding to the\narrest report a description of the reasonable attempt that was made to coordinate diversion as an\nalternative to arrest.\nA person who is deemed to not be a threat of harm to others may still be arrested. One such\ncircumstance might involve an officer taking into custody a person for the purpose of police transport\nto a secure or voluntary crisis facility.\nPage 4 of 10\nWhen an arrest is made under CB 120645, an officer may utilize diversion as a post-arrest alternative to\na jail booking. For instance, an officer that deems a person to be a threat of harm to others could\nchoose to arrest, transport the arrestee to the police precinct, and then later initiate a \u201cwarm handoff\u201d\nto an organization that facilitates diversion (e.g., Let Everyone Advance with Dignity (LEAD)). Presently,\nthe King County Jail is not accepting bookings for most non-violent misdemeanors and would likely not\naccept a booking made for possession of controlled substance or use of controlled substance in a public\nplace. Post-arrest diversion, release, or Charge By Officer4 may be other options for officers who\ndetermine that an individual is a threat of harm to others, but who do not believe that an individual\nmust be sent for a behavior evaluation under Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 71.05 (discussed\nfurther below).\nWhile Section F is titled \u201cThreat of harm to self\u201d, the officer is not required to make a separate\ndetermination about whether a person is a threat of harm to themselves. However, under current law\nand practice, officers may make a determination that a person is in imminent danger because of being\ngravely disabled, a condition that would require officers to take a person into custody for a behavioral\nhealth evaluation under RCW 71.05.\nThreat of harm to others: Councilmembers have asked if existing law provides any guidance on when\nan individual could be deemed a threat of harm to others. While there is no \u201cThreat of Harm Standard\u201d\ndefined in the RCW, officers are at times required to assess a threat of harm when taking certain civil\nactions. For instance, an officer may refer a person for an involuntary behavioral health evaluation\nunder SPD policy 16.110-Pro-1, which empowers officers to take into custody, and deliver to a\ntreatment facility a person who is suffering from a behavioral health disorder and presents an imminent\nlikelihood of serious harm or is in imminent danger because of being gravely disabled. RCW 71.05.020\ndefines the \u201cLikelihood of serious harm\u201d as:\na) A substantial risk that: (i) Physical harm will be inflicted by a person upon his or her own person, as\nevidenced by threats or attempts to commit suicide or inflict physical harm on oneself; (ii) physical\nharm will be inflicted by a person upon another, as evidenced by behavior which has caused such\nharm or which places another person or persons in reasonable fear of sustaining such harm; or\n(iii) physical harm will be inflicted by a person upon the property of others, as evidenced by\nbehavior which has caused substantial loss or damage to the property of others; or (b) The person\nhas threatened the physical safety of another and has a history of one or more violent acts;\u2026.\nThere are also times when an officer is required to assess \u201cthreat\u201d as an element of a crime. The CAO\nindicates that such crimes largely fall within the rubric of harassment (RCW 9A-46). These crimes are\nsubject to arrest when an officer has probable cause to believe that the threat has\n4 The SPD Charge By Officer is a program that allows patrol sergeants to route misdemeanor cases that do not need further investigation\ndirectly to the Seattle Law Department. The policy is not to be used in cases of DUI arrests, incidents involving juveniles, incidents referred\nthrough the Retail Theft Program, Felony charges, Traffic Crimes and infractions, Prostitution Offering & Agreeing, Sexual Exploitation, and\nany crimes that require follow-up by a detective.\nPage 5 of 10\nreached a criminal threshold. The term \u201cthreat\u201d can be found defined in RCW 9A.04.110. Broadly, the\nterm covers actions that communicate, directly or indirectly, the intent to cause bodily injury or to do\nany act which is intended to harm substantially the person threatened or another with respect to his or\nher health, safety, business, financial condition or personal relationships (see definition for complete\nlist acts captured by the definition).\nThreat of harm, as identified in future SPD policies, would likely need be defined in a way that is (1)\nexclusive of other arrestable criminal behavior; and (2) does not capture behavior that could qualify as\na behavioral health crisis that would require an emergent detention for an evaluation under RCW\n71.05.\nArrest Policy Considerations: The Executive has indicated that the final version of CB 120645 will\ninform the Executive Order and SPD Policies, and therefore, the Executive will not make these\ndocuments available to the Council and public until after the adoption of CB 120645.\nThis sequencing precludes the Council from better understanding how the arrest policies of CB 120645\nwill be implemented when officers encounter subjects possessing or using drugs. For example, it is\ndifficult to know whether SPD officers will, when determining the threat of harm to others, weigh more\nheavily factors related to preserving order (e.g., removing non-violent persons using drugs near heavily\ntransited bus stops or commercial properties) or factors that suggest a potential for bodily harm to\nothers (e.g., behavior suggesting a physical threat). SPD policies will need to balance all these factors\nwhile also providing officers with specific, clear/ understandable, and actionable direction.\nExecutive staff have indicated that the SPD policies would be completed and published before the\neffective date of the legislation, which could occur as soon as mid-October under the legislative\nschedule proposed by the Chair of the Council\u2019s PSHS Committee. If the policies affect officer working\nconditions, implementation may require bargaining.\nFiscal impacts\nNet revenue per year from the opioid-settlement resolutions will decline over a 15-year period, so the\nExecutive will have to exercise care in allocating these resources for ongoing expenditures.5 Anticipated\nnet resolution and settlement revenues are not currently known on a per-year basis, but the $20\nmillion the Mayor\u2019s Office has proposed in conjunction with this legislation would result in\napproximately $1.1 million per year for the purposed described, for at least the first seven years of the\npayout period.\n5 The Department of Human Services (HSD) is currently developing a document that will track the revenue and settlement revenues that\nare anticipated per year, and to the extent that additional resolutions and/or settlements are finalized in the future, HSD will update the\ndocument.\nPage 6 of 10\nAll of the proposed new resources announced by the Mayor are for opioid treatment services - that is,\ntreatment and clinical follow-up related to an individual\u2019s substance use disorder, including emergent\nevents such as an overdose. While the proposed investments in treatment may reduce the number of\npeople using drugs in the City and consequently repeated interactions with the criminal legal system,\nand guidance in the legislation directs officers to divert where appropriate, the actual impact on the\nsystem will depend on how many individuals SPD actually refers for diversion and the availability and\nthe appropriateness and capacity of diversion programs. Please see the June 1, 2023, Central Staff\nmemo on CB 120586 \u201cFiscal Responsibility and Impact\u201d section, which reflects the Seattle Municipal\nCourt\u2019s (SMC) indication that case filings are increasing back to pre-pandemic levels and that a\npreliminary estimate of referrals from SPD under the new state legislation is between 700 and 870,\nbased on historical filings before the COVID-19 pandemic. No additional funding is proposed for SPD,\nCAO, or SMC. The fiscal note for CB 120645 confirms that:\nThis legislation may increase the number of criminal charges filed in the Seattle Municipal Court. A\nsignificant increase could eventually result in a need for additional resources in the City Attorney\u2019s\nOffice, the Seattle Municipal Court, or an expansion of the City\u2019s contracted work with the King\nCounty Office of the Public Defender. This legislation may also result in the need for additional\ninvestments in diversion systems, including at pre-arrest, arrest, pre-file, and post-file stages. This\nneed will be explored by the diversion workgroup created as part of Mayor Harrell\u2019s Fentanyl\nSystems Work Group.\nDiversion is different from treatment in that it typically takes place over a longer period of time, can\ninvolve multiple non-clinical social interventions, and requires the intensive participation of a\ncoordinating caseworker. No new funding is proposed for diversion of any kind: pre-arrest, pre-filing, or\npre-trial.\nDiversion\nSubgroups of the Fentanyl Systems Task Force focused on substance use disorder diversion and\ntreatment have not convened, discussed these issues, or issued recommendations. As a result, it is\nunclear what additional analysis and information was used to inform how diversion and treatment\ncould best be used to address the needs of the individuals in this population. Additional issues specific\nto pre-filing and pre-arrest/pre-booking diversion are described below.\nPre-filing diversion\nApproximately $585,000 annually is appropriated to HSD for contracts for pre-filing diversion, and the\nsupplemental budget adds $200,000 of one-time funds for pre-filing diversion in 2023.\nIt is not clear how often pre-filing diversion is the appropriate support for people being stopped or\narrested under CB 120645. Pre-filing diversion may not be an intensive enough intervention for\nindividuals in this population. Challenges for pre-filing diversion programs include the ability to conduct\noutreach immediately and consistently after initial engagement with the criminal legal system;\nproviding the wraparound services that individuals may need to maintain consistent participation in the\nPage 7 of 10\nprograms; and finding sufficient staffing to expand capacity for the needs of this population. For\nexample, while the most appropriate pre-filing diversion intervention for this population might be\nenrollment into King County\u2019s Therapeutic Alternative Diversion (TAD) program, staffing and capacity\nchallenges limit the ability to expand in ways that may not be solved with additional funding.\nPre-arrest or pre-booking diversion\nThe City\u2019s primary option for diversion at the point of arrest is the Let Everyone Advance with Dignity\n(LEAD) program, for which the City contracts6 across the following three referral pathways:\n\u2022 Arrest diversion: referral to LEAD by law enforcement at the point of arrest rather than booking\nfor a crime;\n\u2022 Social contact or pre-arrest diversion: referral to LEAD by law enforcement when there is reason\nto believe that an individual engages in law violations, but law enforcement has no probable\ncause for arrest or the officers choose not to arrest; and\n\u2022 Community referral: no law enforcement role and an individual is referred to LEAD by a\nneighborhood group, business, or social-service or community-based organization.\nCB 120645 will likely lead to increased referral volume to LEAD by establishing diversion and treatment\nas the standard approach for most instances of knowing possession and public use of controlled\nsubstances and in committing to the development of SPD policies to support this outcome. However,\nLEAD currently does not have capacity to accept most new referrals to the program. Even if sufficient\nfunding were allocated to fund LEAD to scale as described in Resolution 31916, the PDA and its\nsubcontractors would require time to recruit, hire, train and deploy the requisite case managers to\nsupport program operation at scale. Given these challenges, it is unlikely that CB 120645 will result in\nsignificantly increased enrollment of new clients in law enforcement assisted diversion programs in the\nnear term.\nThe City\u2019s contract for LEAD services explicitly prioritizes referrals to LEAD by law enforcement,\nincluding pre-arrest diversion and social contact diversion. However, during the first half of 2023 only\nthree percent of all referrals were from arrest diversion, and an additional 25 percent were from social\ncontact, and the majority of referrals were initiated by community members. Significantly more\nreferrals from law enforcement could crowd out the program\u2019s ability to accept referrals from\ncommunity members or create an environment in which police officers are the de facto gatekeepers for\naccess to LEAD programs and services.\nThe City\u2019s 2023 contract with PDA to support the LEAD diversion model is for $9.9 million. With these\nresources, the PDA had 752 active LEAD clients at the end of June. It was not possible to develop an\nestimate for this memo of the additional funding that would be required to fund LEAD to scale. As a\npoint of reference, a September 2021 Central Staff memo (Attachment A) to the PSHS Committee\nestimated the need for $21 million in 2022 and $30 million in 2023 to fund all \u201cpriority qualifying\n6 The contract is held by Purpose. Dignity. Action. (PDA).

Information is not available on the proportion of LEAD\nclients who were connected with the program mainly or solely due to public use of unprescribed or\nillegal controlled substances.\nCentral Staff understand that PDA staff have engaged with the Executive related to CB 120645 and\nidentified the need for ongoing discussion about PDA\u2019s capacity, options for optimizing current\ndiversion resources, and how the bill will be operationalized.\nRacial Equity Impacts\nIn general, the state\u2019s decision to increase criminalization of the knowing possession or use in a public\nplace of unprescribed or illegal controlled substances from a simple to a gross misdemeanor will have\ndisproportionate impacts on Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color. As related to\nenforcement, SPD has been found to disproportionately stop and search Black and Native American\npersons, even though their White counterparts were more likely to be found with a weapon than any\nother demographic group.7\nThe more cases that are prosecuted, the more likely it is that communities of color will experience\ndisproportionate impacts. In addition, the Vera Institute of Justice has found \u201csubstantial evidence\nshows that incarceration is associated with an increased risk of overdose death due to a loss of\ntolerance to opioids, limited access to harm reduction and treatment services, and disruptions in health\ncare and social support during and after periods of incarceration.\u201d8 It is Black and Indigenous\ncommunities, as well as other communities of color\nwho suffer disproportionately from the harms of the criminal legal system and lack of access to health\ncare, and Black and Latinx individuals who are disproportionately represented in jails and prisons,\nleaving these populations subject to the harms of criminalizing drug use and possession.9\nIf the City fully implements the system in this legislation, and that system successfully connects as many\npeople as possible to treatment and support programs that are fully funded, staffed and scaled to\ncapacity appropriate to this population, and does so in a way that decreases additional criminal records\nand involvement with the criminal legal system, the City could address knowing drug possession and\npublic use in a way that produces fewer negative racial equity outcomes. Tracking the appropriate data\nwill be important to understanding racial disparities that remain or are created through these systems.\n7 Dkt-554-1-SPDs-Disparity-Review.pdf (seattle.gov)\n8 Taylor, A., Miller, C., Tan de Bibiana, J., Beck, Jackson, Overdose Deaths and Jail Incarceration, available at\nhttps://www.vera.org/publications/overdose-deaths-and-jail-incarceration/national-trends-and-racial-disparities.\n9 9 Ibid.\nPage 9 of 10\nNext Steps\nThe Public Safety and Human Services committee plans to consider and vote on any amendments to CB\n120645 on September 12, 2023.

The SLI requests the Human Services\nDepartment (HSD) provide estimates for referrals and associated costs if all priority qualifying\nreferrals to the LEAD program citywide are accepted and a description of how these estimates\nwill be incorporated into the Mayor\u2019s 2022 Proposed Budget. Inclusion of the SLI in the 2021\nAdopted Budget was intended to obtain information necessary to assess further action on\nResolution 31916, which calls for appropriate funding to accept all priority qualified referrals for\nthe LEAD program citywide.\nHSD asked LEAD to prepare data-driven calculations to respond to the Council\u2019s request. The\nsubmission of this data was accompanied by a statement from HSD (see Attachment 1)\nrecommending against further expansion of the LEAD program in the 2022 budget so that\nfurther work could be completed to ensure alignment between HSD, LEAD, and other criminal\njustice system alternatives and the impact of the Council\u2019s appropriation of $3 million for LEAD\nin June 2021 could be assessed.\nThis memo examines the referral and cost estimates prepared by LEAD The estimate provided by\nLEAD would result in a total program cost of $21 million in 2022 and $30 million in 2023 to\naccept all priority qualifying referrals, an increase above current levels of $13 million and $21\nmillion, respectively.\nDefinition of Priority Qualifying Referral\nThe SLI is focused on serving all priority qualifying referrals to LEAD. A \u201cpriority qualifying\nreferral\u201d is a term that allows for subjective judgements based on the specific circumstances of\nthe referral. Generally, LEAD clients are individuals who engage in criminal activity related to\nbehavioral health issues, substance use, and/or extreme poverty or income instability. Arrest\ndiversion to LEAD has been authorized from the program\u2019s outset in 2011 for drug crimes and\nprostitution, and as of 2018, the Seattle Police Department and City Attorney\u2019s Office have\nexpressed an intent to allow arrest diversion of criminal trespass, theft, property destruction,\nand obstructing charges. Arrest diversion for non-domestic violence assault and harassment has\nAttachment A - September 2021 Memo\nbeen discussed by City departments as a potential further arrest diversion expansion for people\nlikely not to be legally competent for criminal proceedings due to acute mental illness. Per\nPage 1 of 5\nchanges mandated by the Council in the 2020 Mid-Year Supplemental Budget (Ordinance\n126148), LEAD referrals can be approved if the LEAD project management team determines that\nthe referred individual chronically violates the law, that accepting the referral is consistent with\nracial equity, and if the LEAD case management teams believe that the resources available to\nthem are appropriate to the individual\u2019s known needs.\nOver the last year, factors determining when there is a priority qualifying referral have included\nexamining whether the referred individual has experienced intergenerational poverty, been\nimpacted by the war on drugs, or reported intergenerational behavioral health or chemical\ndependency issues. Black, indigenous, and other people of color are generally prioritized. An\nindividual\u2019s actual community impact, such as having known warrants and open court cases is\nconsidered. Due to direction from Council regarding geographic expansion and areas of focus,\ngeographic location can be a reason for not accepting a referral.\nReferral and Caseload Estimates\nTo estimate total priority qualifying referrals City-wide, LEAD conducted a survey of partners that\ncurrently refer clients to the program. The survey asked for the estimated number of Seattle-\nbased referrals the partner would send if LEAD had sufficient funding to accept all priority\nqualifying referrals (see Attachment 2 for details). After obtaining this data, LEAD reduced the\nnumber of referrals based on the current rate of duplicate referrals and proportion of individuals\nwho do not complete intake into the program. This resulted in an estimate that 2,586 referrals\nwould be made over the course of 2022, resulting in 1,450 individuals entering the program.\nGenerally speaking, a LEAD client falls into one of three stages. The most common stage is an\nactive client who is intensely and actively meeting with the LEAD clinical team more than once\nevery three months. The second stage, outreach, is a client who has contact with the LEAD\nclinical team but is not considered intensely engaged and typically has less than one contact\nevery three months. A third stage, alumni, is a stabilized client who no longer requires intensive\ncare coordination but may occasionally return for some assistance. Clients in any stage are\nconsidered discharged or disengaged in the event the person is sent to prison, moves out of the\narea, is out of contact for more than a year, or dies. Over the last year, it is estimated that a\nclient remains in the active stage for an average of eight months, outreach for an average of six\nmonths, and alumni status for an average of four months. It is not uncommon for a client to\nmove between the active and outreach stages.\nThe estimate of caseload prepared by LEAD in the SLI response assumes that new referrals who\ncomplete the intake process always move into the active LEAD caseload. It also assumes a fixed\nnumber of program exits each month in order to project the net caseload growth. Significantly,\nPage 2 of 5\nAttachment A - September 2021 Memo\nthe LEAD estimate assumes that new community-based organizations and public safety\ninitiatives would become operational by 2023, and some individuals who might otherwise\nqualify for LEAD would be referred to those programs and resources rather than to LEAD. Such\na change in the rate of referrals would slow the rate that the monthly caseload increases (see\nthe solid blue line in Chart 1). However, absent the development of those alternative pathways\nby 2023, LEAD caseload could continue to rise substantially (see the dotted blue line in Chart 1)\nand there is a risk that the program would need to limit or pause accepting referrals.\nCentral Staff sought to confirm LEAD\u2019s caseload projection based on the average time spent in\neach stage of the program. The Central Staff projection does not assume the rate of referrals to\nLEAD would decrease in 2023 due to new program alternatives, but it does assume that the\nnumber of referrals each month remains the same after reaching the levels projected from the\npartner survey. With these underlying assumptions, the rate of caseload increase in the Central\nStaff projection levels off in 2023 but continues to increase (See the green line in Chart 1).\nChart 1: LEAD Caseload Projections Using Different Underlying Assumptions\nNeither the LEAD nor the Central Staff projection reach a point where the outflow of clients\nbalances the inflow of new referrals. So in both projections, the caseload would interminably\nincrease. If correct, the projections would therefore suggest that either the definition of a\npriority qualifying referral requires narrowing or new practices must be developed to more\nrapidly exit clients from LEAD.\nPage 3 of 5\nAttachment A - September 2021 Memo\nThe need for such changes could be even greater than suggested by these projections if the\nnumber of referrals increased more than estimated by the partner survey. For example, both the\nLEAD and the Central Staff caseload estimates assume that no new referral sources emerge as\nfunding for the program increases. However, it is possible, perhaps likely, that new community\npartners would begin to provide referrals or that greater awareness of LEAD\u2019s presence in a\ncommunity would impact the number of referrals. It is not possible to project what those\nimpacts could be at this time.\nNevertheless, it is important to remember there were numerous assumptions made to develop\nthese estimates and the slower rate of caseload increase could be an indication that in-flow and\nout-flow are beginning to balalnce. If LEAD funding is increased in the future, the accuracy of\nthese assumptions should be monitored to better project if caseload will reach an equilibrium.\nCost Estimates\nLEAD developed a staffing and cost model that varies based on the total program caseload each\nmonth. The model uses existing salary, benefit, and operational costs, though they are not\nadjusted for inflation or other changes over time. It assumes one case manager for every twenty\nactive cases and one for every 80 outreach cases. The modeling assumes that 15 percent of\nactive clients would receive hotel sheltering supports. Chart 2 shows the estimated cost of\naccepting all priority qualified referrals citywide using this staffing and cost model and the\ncaseload estimates discussed above.\nChart 2: Estimated Total Cost to Accept All Priority Qualified Referrals City-wide (Dollars in\nMillions)\nPage 4 of 5\nAttachment A - September 2021 Memo\n40\n33.7\n35\n29.8\n30 28.5\n25\n21.0 21.0 20.3\n20\n15\n11.3 11.3\n10\n5\n0\n2021 2022 2023\nLEAD Projection\nLEAD Projection without Alternative Programs\nCentral Staff Projection (Using Current Service Duration, No Alternative Programs)\nOther public entities could support some of these estimated costs along with the City. In\naddition to City General Fund support that is provided through HSD, LEAD currently receives\nfunds through two contracts with King County. The King County Mental Illness and Drug\nDependency Sales Tax (MIDD) currently provides nearly $1.5 million to support LEAD in Seattle.\nLEAD assumes that funding will increase by four percent in each of the next two years due to\ninflationary adjustments. Similarly, LEAD receives approximately $380,000 from the Trueblood\nCourt Monitor for pre-booking police diversion of individuals whose law violations were thought\nto stem from high acuity mental health needs, though the Trueblood funding will end in June\n2022. In addition, there are multiple other public funding sources that could potentially support\nthe program, including State funding for the Recovery Navigator Program and State mental\nhealth services funding.\nAssuming that the on-going funding from HSD increases by four percent over each of the next\ntwo years, City funding is expected to already be $6.5 million in 2022 and $6.7 million in 2023.\nThese amounts do not include $3 million one-time funding provided by the Council for the LEAD\nprogram in 2021 through Ordinance 126375, which is assumed to end without Council action.\nNext Steps\nIn the next week, the Council will receive the Mayor\u2019s 2022 Proposed Budget. Through that\nprocess, the Council will have the opportunity to deliberate over funding for LEAD in 2022. The\nSLI was intended to provide Council the information needed for those deliberations.\nPage 5 of 5\nAttachment A - September 2021 Memo\nAttachments:\n1.

HSD is\ntransmitting the report on behalf of LEAD.\nCurrent City of Seattle Investments in LEAD\nThis SLI was approved and included in the 2021 City of Seattle Budget which invested $6 million in LEAD. In\nJune 2021, Ordinance 126298 appropriated an additional $3 million to LEAD.\nAt this time, we cannot support an expansion of the program, as the data outlined in this report is\ninsufficient to understand the total cost of expanding the LEAD program. In 2022, HSD\u2019s contract with LEAD\nis transitioning over to the newly formed Safe & Thriving Communities (STC) division. HSD recommends any\ndiscussion related to evaluation, cost analysis, or impact analysis of LEAD be delayed to 2022 in order to (1)\nallow STC to ensure alignment with LEAD and other systemic responses to criminal justice system\nalternatives and (2) allow sufficient time to contract and evaluate impact of the $3M midyear budget add to\nLEAD in 2021 spearheaded by Councilmember Herbold.\nAttachment\nLead Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003\nLead Core Principles\n[Type here]\nAttachment 2: LEAD Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003\n(revised September 17, 2021) Attachment A - September 2021 Memo\n700 Fifth Avenue, Suite 5800 | PO Box 34215 | Seattle, WA 98124-4215 | 206-386-1001 | seattle.gov/department\nLEAD Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003 revised\nSeptember 17, 2021\nWe appreciate the opportunity to address what would be required to expand LEAD to scale throughout the City of\nSeattle, including the capacity to accept any and all arrest diversions and appropriate community referrals.\n\u201cScale\u201d is defined, in Resolution 31916, as the capacity to accept all priority qualifying referrals, to ongoing case\nmanagement and care coordination without a pre-determined end date.\nWe begin with a brief background on the present scope and impact of LEAD, and then explore possible models\nfor calculating expansion to scale.\nI. LEAD summarized\nLEAD began as a resolution of long-running litigation from 2001-2008 by PDA\u2019s (Public Defender\u2019s Office) Racial\nDisparity Project and the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project, challenging the over-policing of Black people delivering\ncrack cocaine, and demonstrating that white people constitute the majority of those dealing drugs in outdoor\ndrug markets in Seattle. Since 2011, PDA has served as the project manager for LEAD \u2013 Let Everyone Advance\nwith Dignity \u2013 formerly called Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion \u2013 in Seattle-King County,1 which provides\ncommunity-based care for people who commit law violations related to behavioral health issues or extreme\npoverty, as an alternative to punitive enforcement-based responses.\nIndividuals referred to LEAD receive immediate access to harm reduction-based intensive case- management,\nincluding \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 chemical dependency treatment, mental health care, legal system support, and\njob training and placement. LEAD participants are those who commit, or are at high risk of committing, law\nviolations related to their behavioral health challenges and/or income instability. LEAD case management follows\nthe harm reduction principle of taking the harm seriously--the central program goal is to reduce problematic and\nillegal behavior, and thereby to reduce the \u201cpolice-ability\u201d of individuals who in the past have largely been\nrebuffed by care systems and exposed to enforcement and the legal system as a primary response for behavioral\nhealth conditions and income instability. Police and court response is reduced by providing an alternative,\ncommunity-based response that is reliable and satisfying to participants and community alike.\nAdditionally, in 2018, the Policy Coordinating Group decided to respond to an RFP (Request for Proposal)\nfrom the Trueblood Court Monitor which sought proposals for pre-booking police diversion of individuals\nwhose law violations were thought to stem from high acuity mental health needs, and LEAD was selected to\nexpand services to this population. Pursuant to the award of Trueblood funding, beginning July 1, 2018, LEAD\nlaw enforcement partners were formally able to refer individuals to LEAD when they are under arrest for a\nwider range of offenses, approved by the Policy Coordinating Group. Phase I of the expanded arrest diversion\neligibility criteria included criminal trespass, theft and property destruction (which, after extensive data\nreview by SPD, the CAO (City Attorney Office), King County BHRD (Behavioral Health and Recovery Division)\nand PDA, were found to account for nearly half of cases in which individuals were held for competency\nevaluation on Seattle Municipal Court cases in the first quarter of 2018). Phase II expansion\n(Memorandum of Understanding), making decisions by consensus, comprised of (for Seattle) the Mayor, City\nCouncil, City Attorney and Seattle Police Department, as well as the King County Executive, Council, Prosecutor and\nSheriff, the ACLU of Washington, and the Public Defender Association, which serves as project manager. The PCG\n[Type here]\nAttachment 2: LEAD Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003\n(revised September 17, 2021) Attachment A - September 2021 Memo\nmeets quarterly. The advocacy organizations represented were those that litigated the race discrimination challenge\nthat catalyzed LEAD. The MOU could be amended by consensus to add or remove stakeholders. PDA is the project\nmanager working for the PCG--if the PCG so chose, it could select another project management entity. In that sense,\nLEAD is not a project of PDA, and it can continue if PDA were no longer selected to provide project management.\nmay include non-domestic violence assault and harassment. However, to date, there have been no arrest\ndiversions on these expanded arrest diversion criteria.\nLEAD has recognized core principles (attached to this memo) that are essential to its recognition as an\nevidence-based approach, and which are used by evaluators nationally to measure fidelity to the model.\nThese principles are currently in use by the Washington Health Care Authority in designing the SB5476\n\u201cRecovery Navigator\u201d program which, per that legislation, must align with LEAD core principles. Within\nthose core principles, however, there is substantial room for program adaptation, including in the model of\ncare. The model is intended to accomplish the maximum possible paradigm shift from legal system\ninvolvement to community-based care. It is also meant to establish a floor, not a ceiling, on the resources\nindividuals are provided to stabilize, recover and heal from complex trauma and harm.\nIt is often said that LEAD is not a program or a single organization, but a collective impact model creating a\nframework for diversion to community-based care of individuals who do commit law violations related to\nbehavioral health issues or income instability, where there is a public expectation of enforcement response, and\nwhere it is clear that a punitive response is harmful and counterproductive. In contrast to gun violence, the\nimpact of each instance of problematic behavior may be less severe, but taken together, these behaviors are\nproblematic, for vulnerable communities as well as for more affluent ones, and require a response \u2013 and the\nnumber of individuals who fall into the category of eligible priority referrals is large, because these problems and\nsituations are pervasive, for systemic reasons that are not likely to be soon resolved.\nFrom time to time the Policy Coordinating Group convenes an evaluation and data working group to assess\nprogram operations and impacts. In 2019, among other areas of focus, that workgroup looked at LEAD\u2019s impact\non racial disparity and race equity. Black and other POC participants have always constituted a majority of LEAD\nparticipants. The benefits of the program in reducing felony filings, prison and jail time, and subsequent arrests,\nwere found by a UW research team to be experienced equally by LEAD participants regardless of race. LEAD case\nmanagement was already regarded as a higher level of care than has traditionally been offered to this participant\ngroup. In 2019, the evaluation and data workgroup determined that increasing the level of care offered to\nparticipants to include both more access to housing and a channel to secure legal income constituted appropriate\nmodifications to the LEAD standard of care. In 2020, amidst the pandemic, the Policy Coordinating Group\nconfirmed that more certain access to housing and legal income supports should be considered, as much as\npossible, essential to the LEAD model of care.\nIn Fall 2019, the 2020 budget process saw a commitment to take LEAD to full scale citywide by 2023, in Resolution\n31916, and nearly tripled the City\u2019s investment in the program, to restore ability to take on new referrals and\nalleviate crushing caseloads that were created when referrals mounted in 2018-2019 without significant increases\nin funding (other than Trueblood). The Policy Coordinating Group directed, and the City contract with PDA\nanticipated, that a second case management team would be created in 2020, so that REACH would not have to\ncarry the planned growth of the program alone.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic elevated the need for a housing-based approach and a legal income stream to meet\nbasic needs. It also accelerated the need for a second case management team. The brokerage case management\napproach LEAD has historically used was less usable when almost all other services became inaccessible to the\nLEAD participant population during the COVID shutdown. At the same time, jails declined to book on low level\n[Type here]\nAttachment 2: LEAD Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003\n(revised September 17, 2021) Attachment A - September 2021 Memo\noffenses, police had little contact, and courts closed, meaning that the LEAD population was largely left out on\nthe streets unable to safely shelter in place and without access to lawful income. In response, with agreement of\nthe PCG, PDA developed Co-LEAD, an intensive outreach and case management team that was able to provide\nthis population temporary lodging at hotels as well as wraparound, on-site services. Co-LEAD, thus, is the second\nLEAD case management team, presently deployed to quasi-residential program sites for participants for whom\nthat is the necessary level of care.\nThe other major change to the LEAD model in 2020 was the advent of direct community referrals, without\ninvolvement of or approval from law enforcement. In the past, LEAD was intentionally designed to intercept\nindividuals who were suspected of crimes and otherwise would be subject to being jailed and prosecuted, in\norder to prevent that harm. In 2020, initially due to the impact of COVID, and later in response to regional\nreconsideration of the appropriate role for police, jails, courts and police largely withdrew from engaging this\npopulation. However, large numbers struggled with lack of access to lawful income, engagement in the illicit\neconomy to meet basic needs, and record levels of harmful substance use and untreated mental illness. The need\nremained, but the intercept channel needed to be adjusted to ensure LEAD services reached those they were\ndesigned to assist. Recognizing this, in summer 2020, the LEAD project management team proposed, and the City\nand County Councils required by budget proviso, that community referrals be accepted without the previous\nrequirement of law enforcement approval.\nPresently, LEAD arrest diversion, street outreach, case management, and direct services are available for\nindividuals who pose a risk of ongoing law violations (are exposed to enforcement and the legal system) due to\nbehavioral health conditions or extreme poverty. Without prior approval from law enforcement personnel, under\nterms of the City and County Council budget provisos, LEAD referrals can be approved if the LEAD project\nmanagement team determines that the referred individual chronically violates the law, that accepting the referral\nis consistent with racial equity, and if the LEAD case management team(s) believe that the resources available to\nthem are appropriate to the individual\u2019s known needs.\nWith the advent of direct community referrals, we are seeing widespread community willingness to make\nreferrals directly to LEAD without involving law enforcement at all. We have also seen requests from new\nneighborhoods for a LEAD response, sometimes communicated directly to HSD, and sometimes via community\nstakeholders and councilmembers. As of 2021, Community Referrals make up the large majority (>80%) of new\nLEAD referrals. As a result, the LEAD Project Management Team (LPMT) has had to put the majority of eligible\nreferrals on pause as demand for the program has outpaced current LEAD resources.\nResearch demonstrating LEAD\u2019s positive impact on recidivism, income and shelter outcomes has been published\nin peer-reviewed journals. This research was calculated conservatively using metrics approved by an evaluation\nadvisory committee that include representatives from the Seattle Mayor\u2019s Office and Council, as well as the King\nCounty Executive, Council and Department of Adult & Juvenile Detention.\nII. Scope of LEAD Operations at present\nCapacity for new referrals has been exhausted. Although LEAD services are technically available in all precincts,\nthe service provision is not available in every neighborhood and does not operate at saturation levels.2 HSD has\nhad over 200 community originated referrals since the opening of the direct Community Referral process in\nAugust 2020, after provisos were passed in King County Council and Seattle City Council directing the end of law\nenforcement\u2019s role as sole gatekeeper to services.\nREACH LEAD caseloads are again at levels seen in 2019 which caused the last referral shutdown, and which are\nknown to imperil effective case management (the 2019 legislation requires an average caseload of no more than\n[Type here]\nAttachment 2: LEAD Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003\n(revised September 17, 2021) Attachment A - September 2021 Memo\n20 cases and a maximum of 25 cases; LEAD case managers are in general once again far above that level.\nIntensive case management best practice caseload levels are 12-15 cases by comparison).\nThroughout the City of Seattle, neighborhoods and businesses have demonstrated that they are willing to call\ndirectly for community-based care responses to low level criminal activity or other problematic or concerning\nbehavior, when it is evident to them that the behavior results from behavioral health issues or poverty, and that\nthey have confidence in the LEAD model, which emphasizes ongoing accountability and transparent\n2 Saturation implies felt neighborhood impact by the project and that any or all eligible referrals can be staffed with\nthe program in a manner that complies with program fidelity\ncommunication to those who make referrals. The LEAD model is capable of generating a high level of felt\nlegitimacy for alternative community-based responses to such criminal activity. However, our capacity ceiling\nprevents acceptance of most such referrals, leaving willing communities without anywhere to turn for these\nlegitimate public safety and order needs.\nThis inability to operate at scale has left response and service gaps for most public health/public safety issues. For\nexample, businesses and individuals in the Mount Baker neighborhood organized to request LEAD services\nthroughout Q2 2021. LEAD outreached the neighborhood to assess its needs and found that businesses,\nindividuals, and service providers were prepared to immediately refer a number of potential clients. Among these\nreferrals were a number of people residing in the Cheasty Greenbelt prior to the fatal encampment fire on June\n15, 2021. As LEAD works to bring its services to scale, the public safety and well- being of potential LEAD clients in\nthe Mount Baker neighborhood continues to be tenuous. Throughout the City, eager referral sources are being\ntold that we cannot accept their priority appropriate referrals.\nIII. Factors bearing on scope of expansion to scale by 2023\nCalculating the scope and cost of providing a response to all appropriate priority referrals requires determining\nthe following:\n\u25cf (Arrest referrals) how many individuals are/will be subject to arrest by SPD where it would be\nappropriate to refer to LEAD in lieu of arrest in at least some instances -- and on what charges is\nthe option of referral to LEAD desired? Here it is important to note that there were already\nmany missed opportunities since 2018 for pre-booking diversion of individuals who meet\nTrueblood criteria and are arrested and booked for criminal trespass, property destruction and\ntheft; however, query the rate at which individuals are being arrested and booked for these\ncharges since the landscape changes in 2020;\n\u25cf (Community referrals) how many individuals are projected to be referred by various community\nsources, including o Neighborhood groups o Business groups o Service providers o\nDepartment of Public Defense o City Attorney o King County Prosecutor o Courts (including\nSeattle Municipal Court\u2019s LEAD calendar and Community Court) o Jail discharge planners;\n\u25cf Compensation adjustments needed to recruit and retain the workforce needed to effectively\nengage and support the LEAD participant population; and\n\u25cf Value of expanding the number of case management providers to whom referrals may be\nassigned, to allow for greater specialization and investment in a diverse array of community\norganizations (recalling that LEAD is a framework for diversion, not a program of a single\norganization), as a system of multiple providers entails some degree of supervision and\nadministrative duplication that increases costs while also increasing equity in investment and\nhelping to develop capacity in a wide array of community organizations to do this work.\n[Type here]\nAttachment 2: LEAD Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003\n(revised September 17, 2021) Attachment A - September 2021 Memo\nDiversifying the case management organizations also requires investment in technical support\nfrom the existing case management organizations for the new partners.\nIV. Forecast of Priority Qualifying Referrals, including social referrals with or without law enforcement and\narrest referrals\nThis forecast is of limited utility in predicting the scope of expansion to scale because current referrals are\nconstrained by our known lack of capacity to accept them, and by the fact that we conduct no affirmative\noutreach to recruit referrals or to make community and neighborhood organizations aware of this option, since\nwe know we do not have the capacity to respond to additional referrals. This is offered for what it may be\nworth in understanding even the very constrained scope of current referrals.\nCOMMUNITY REFERRAL SURVEY\nData from neighbors, neighborhood advocacy groups, and out-of-network social service organizations were\ngathered via a survey which asked respondents about the number of referrals they anticipate that they will make\nin 2022. Respondents were selected based on an assessment of which individuals and groups are likely to utilize\nthe community-based referral system in 2022. Although survey respondents represent a wide variety of Seattle\nneighborhoods, it should be noted that response rate was below 33%, and that survey results comprise a partial\nrepresentation of anticipated LEAD referrals in 2022.\nThose who responded include:\n\u2022 North Helpline\n\u2022 Real Escape from the Sex Trade (REST)\n\u2022 U District Partnership\n\u2022 Interim CDA\n\u2022 Alliance for Pioneer Square\n\u2022 Anything Helps\n\u2022 Aurora Commons\n\u2022 Mercy House\n\u2022 Various individual businesses\n\u2022 Community members who have made referrals (not affiliated with other respondents already listed)\nPROJECTIONS\nProjections for referrals based on Q1 of 2021:\n\u2022 Community Referrals \u2013 548\n\u2022 Social Contact \u2013 124\n\u2022 Arrest Diversions - 4 (caveat that expanded arrest diversion criteria are not yet in use)\nThese numbers are projections for the remainder of 2021 based on LEAD referrals for the first quarter of the year.\nDuring the first quarter, community referrals were incoming at a high rate as the program had the capacity to take\non these referrals. The numbers above reflect the projected amount of referrals if LEAD was able to take on\ncommunity referrals at the same capacity. Shortly after Q1 LPMT placed most community referrals on pause due\nto capacity so further projections of community referrals based on Q2 would be an inaccurate estimate of current\ndemand of LEAD services in the areas in Seattle in which LEAD is active and we are prioritizing referrals.\nAdditionally, SPD, especially in West Seattle, are starting to make more Social Contact referrals so we estimate our\nSocial Contact estimates to potentially increase.\n[Type here]\nAttachment 2: LEAD Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003\n(revised September 17, 2021) Attachment A - September 2021 Memo\nPDA provided the following projection to City Council, on October 2, 2019, for estimated Law Enforcement LEAD\nreferrals in Seattle based on referral rates in 2018 and 2019 (it is evident that these projections pertained to an\nera of greater SPD staffing and focus on public order offenses than we see at present or are likely to see going\nforward):\nV. Estimated referral volume at scale\nNo single existing data source smoothly predicts or allows estimation of appropriate priority LEAD referrals.\n\u2022 Arrest numbers are not a useful guide to the LEAD-eligible population, as LEAD can work with individuals\nwho are (or reasons including an increased community desire for an alternative to police response,\nimpact of the COVID pandemic on police response, intentional jail use decreases, police staffing\nshortages to justice system priorities) not going to be arrested, despite that they are committing law\nviolations. Social contact referrals approved by law enforcement have long outstripped arrest referrals\n(80% to 20% in 2017). In Q1, 2021 Community Referrals made up 81.1% of LEAD referrals, social contact\nreferrals by police made up 18.3% of LEAD referrals, and arrest diversions only comprised 0.6% of overall\nLEAD referrals.\n\u2022 The King County Point in Time (PIT) Count of those who are living homeless, while it estimates the\npercentage of unsheltered individuals who are drug users, also under-estimates the LEAD-eligible\npopulation, because not all who are LEAD-eligible are unsheltered. LEAD, at its core, is an alternative,\ncommunity-based care response to law violations/low level crime, which will be needed even if great\nprogress is made on unsheltered homelessness in coming months and years.\nInstead, the total number of priority appropriate LEAD referrals can be loosely estimated or triangulated from\nan assortment of data sources, with a discount factor for estimating unduplicated individual who would be\nreferred, acknowledging the likelihood that some individuals overlap these referral sources:\n[Type here]\nAttachment 2: LEAD Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003\n(revised September 17, 2021) Attachment A - September 2021 Memo\n\u2022 Survey of the most common community referral sources to estimate the number of individuals they\nwould want to refer for LEAD services over a single year, if LEAD had the capacity to accept all\nappropriate priority referrals.\n\u2022 Adjust upward by 25% for impact of greater awareness, publicity/intentional advertising of this option\n\u2022 \u201cIntercept 0\u201d referrals from legal system partners (these are \u201cintercept 0 referrals,\u201d as they are\nidentified based on past legal system involvement and known vulnerability to future encounters with law\nenforcement and the legal system absent a care-based intervention\u2014they are not post-booking or post-\nfiling diversion referrals). The legal system partners consulted are:\no Seattle Municipal Court Community Court o Department of\nPublic Defense o Seattle City Attorney\u2019s Office\no King County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office (KCPAO)\n\u2022 SPD estimates of likely arrest and social contact referrals, to the extent they differ from patterns we are\ncurrently seeing based on intentional policymaking by SPD leadership, the City Council or the Mayor\u2019s\nOffice. Absent an estimate SPD or City officials will espouse, the LEAD project management team is using\n2021 current projections as a placeholder.\n\u2022 Adjust the cumulative number arrived at through the above estimation exercises downward by 20% to\nestimate unduplicated individuals to be referred\n\u2022 Adjust the number to be staffed with case managers downward by 30% to reflect the number of\nindividuals who do not complete the intake process, when the outreach follow up is robust and not\nlimited by COVID.\n\u2022 Factor in clients who exit the LEAD program (estimated at 20% after two years), which creates additional\ncapacity.\n\u2022 Factor in the need to maintain capacity constantly to take new referrals, the need to locate teams in\ngeographically specific zones of work, and the desire to have teams in different provider organizations\nfor reasons of balance, specialization and cultural expertise, all of which create an upward ratchet in\ncase manager positions not reflected in the 1:20 calculation.\n\u2022 Factor in the assumption that other crucial social services will come online for LEAD\u2019s client\ndemographic, which will distribute the service load currently bearing on the LEAD program. Derive a\nprojected number of additional case managers needed in coming years until an equilibrium point is\nreached where program departures roughly balance new intakes, and a stable workforce is arrived at.\nUsing the above methodology, and after surveying partners and considering current referral rates, the LEAD\nproject management team projects a referral volume of 2,586 in 2022, as follows:\nReferral Source Number of Projected Referrals\nSurvey of Community Referral Sources 1128 projected annual community referrals from all\n(exclusive of legal sources10) sources (acknowledge that 25% upward adjustment\n10 As of June 8th, 2021, community referrals had come from a variety of sources including REACH (36.1% of\nreferrals), Co-LEAD (19.5%), the Department of Public Defense (10%), Everspring (9.2%), and the Seattle Police\nDepartment (5.5%). Other referral sources, whose respective referrals each account for less than 5% of the total,\ninclude but are not limited to the Aurora Commons, the Seattle Fire Department, the King County Prosecuting\nAttorney's Office, the University of Washington Police Department, the Seattle City Attorney's Office, Asian\nCounseling and Referral Services, family/friend referrals, and self-referrals.\n[Type here]\nAttachment 2: LEAD Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003\n(revised September 17, 2021) Attachment A - September 2021 Memo\ncould occur with intentional communication that\nthis option is available)\nSurvey of legal system partners and review of SMC \u25cf 520-1040 projected annual referrals from\nfiling data provided by the City Attorney\u2019s Office Community Court (mean=780)\n\u25cf An additional estimated unduplicated\n300 individuals filed in\nSMC not passing through\nCommunity Court\n\u25cf An additional estimated\nunduplicated 250 individuals referred\nfor filing to KCPAO\n\u25cf Total: 1330 internally unduplicated referrals\nfrom legal system partners\nBased on SPD Referral Patterns \u2022 128 annual internally unduplicated referrals\nfrom SPD\nProjected Total \u2022 2586 referrals\nAfter factoring the 20% probability of duplicate referrals between different referral sources, a number of the\ntotal 2586 referrals can be discounted. In addition to this duplication reduction, an intake reduction should\nalso be applied. Each of these priority referrals would have a staffing impact for the outreach/screening\nfunction (in-field staff who seek out and patiently engage individuals who are not yet ready to work with case\nmanagers). The case management cohort is estimated to need to absorb 70% of this number, as prompt\noutreach when fully staffed and not impacted by COVID is estimated to engage and facilitate intake for 70% of\nreferrals, up somewhat from the \u201cconversion to intake\u201d rate from recent years when outreach staff were far\nunder needed capacity. With both reductions and with monthly rounding, the projection model assumes that\n1451 individuals will be assigned to a case manager in 2022.\nTo determine how many additional case managers would be needed until an equilibrium between new referrals\n(after current demand is absorbed) and program graduates/departures is reached, we use the average caseload\nratio established by the City Council in 2019 (1:20), to determine that, in 2022, 66 new case managers would be\nrequired with the new referral volume. Individuals departing the program (REACH staff estimate 20% after two\nyears) at the same time create some additional capacity, while the need to maintain capacity constantly to take\nnew referrals, the need to locate teams in geographically specific zones of work, and the desire to have teams in\ndifferent provider organizations for reasons of balance, specialization, and cultural expertise, requires an upward\nratchet in case manager positions not reflected in the 1:20 calculation. Taking these two factors together into\nconsideration, 66 is a reasonable estimate of the number of added case managers projected to be needed in\n2022.\nGrowth in referral volume and the case management workforce requires some additional staff for milieu\nmanagement, outreach, and clinical supervision, as well as increased flex funds for participant basic needs and\ndirect support.\nVI. Cost estimates to support pre-arrest diversion services for those referrals citywide in 2022 and 2023\n[Type here]\nAttachment 2: LEAD Project Management Team Response to SLI HSD-006-A-003\n(revised September 17, 2021) Attachment A - September 2021 Memo\nCOST\n\u2022 Requires determination of compensation to address workforce challenges and appropriate equitable\ncompensation for work of this significance and challenge. Front line FTEs should be budgeted at\n$54,000$70,000 (mean of $62,000) and supervisors at $70,000-$95,000 (mean of $82,500).\n\u2022 Requires estimating added cost (for supervision, administration, and technical support) if multiple case\nmanagement providers are engaged. There are presently three LEAD case management teams (REACH,\nCo-LEAD & Community Passageways) in Seattle or adjacent communities; additional providers, if desired\n(which LEAD partners support) will decrease cost efficiency to a degree because of admin duplication,\nbut this inefficiency is offset by the opportunity for specialization, cultural expertise, and a more stable\nworkforce base not dependent on a small number of providers.\n\u2022 Requires assessment of whether additional neighborhood-based office locations are needed apart from\nNorth and East spaces already secured. It is likely that SE Seattle and SODO workspaces will be needed,\nand that the satellite office space costs should be increased from current; costs likely would not double\ngiven the favorable commercial lease rates presently available. This is not included in the present budget\nprojections.\n\u2022 Possible additional cost for participant income stabilization and basic needs provision. Propose that flex\nfunds and cash support be increased by 25%; alternatively, or additionally, that a local minimum income\nprogram be established (not only for LEAD participants).\n\u2022 Assessment of whether quasi-residential model is essential for impact for some participants and if so,\nstrategies for providing space. Propose that City leaders encourage engage the Regional Homelessness\nAuthority and the County\u2019s Health Through Housing leadership to ensure that this population, sitting at\nthe intersection of homelessness and exposure to the criminal legal system, be prioritized for both\nnoncongregate shelter programs and permanent housing placements, especially ARPA vouchers that can\npair with long term LEAD case management to address housing needs of this chronically unsheltered\nhigh barrier population.\nNote on additional available resources for LEAD expansion: Resolution 31916 requires that there be public funding\nfor all appropriate priority LEAD referrals -- it does not limit that public funding source to the City general fund. There\nare immediate prospects for increased public support for LEAD via State funding for implementation of the SB 5476\nRecovery Navigator program, which is required to operate on LEAD core principles. Trueblood, 988 and other mental\nhealth services funding in the 2021 Washington State budget are also likely sources to supplement local LEAD\nfunding. Federal funding for LEAD expansion is also likely, and Representative Jayapal has consistently offered to\npursue that channel.",

Reasonableness is determined from the perspective of a reasonable officer facing similar circumstances. \n\n3. An officer will not arrest ((in this situation)) when the individual only poses a threat of harm to self absent articulable facts and circumstances warranting such action and SPD policies and/or training will identify what additional articulable facts and circumstances would warrant arrest. \n\n4. ((A determination of a)) The threat of harm assessment will govern officer decisionmaking and will not be an element of the crime to be proved during the prosecution of the crimes described in subsection 3.28.141.A ((possession and public use)) and cannot be used as a defense at trial. \n\nGI.

Reporting. If an officer determines, based on the totality of circumstances, that an arrest is authorized by this Section 3.28.141, an arrest report shall be completed by the officer that includes, at a minimum, the facts establishing probable cause, an assessment of the threat presented by the individual ((engaged in possession and public use)), and whether, and in what manner, arrest or diversion was considered or utilized.\n\nL.  Based on officer availability, location, and deployment limitations, SPD shall seek to prioritize use of officers who have received at least 40 hours of crisis intervention team (CIT) training when enforcing the crimes described in subsection 3.28.141.A.\n\nAdd a new Section 4 to CB 120645 and renumber subsequent sections:\n\nSection 4.

This committee shall advise the Mayor, City Council, the Seattle Police Department (SPD), and the Civilian Assisted Response and Engagement (CARE) Department on an ongoing basis regarding any need for change in operationalized police protocols, legislation, or other policies. Committee approval shall not be required prior to implementation of SPD policies. \n\nA. Reporting. The behavioral health alternatives committee created in this section shall produce bi-annually a report that identifies for individuals who are referred to diversion through SPD social contact, demographic and other information as recommended by the state\u2019s substance abuse and recovery services plan.

Contact:\n\nCBO Contact:\n\n\n\nAndrew Myerberg\n\n\t\t\n\n* Note that the Summary and Fiscal Note describes the version of the bill or resolution as introduced; final legislation including amendments may not be fully described.\n\n1. BILL SUMMARY\n\n\n\nLegislation Title: AN ORDINANCE relating to controlled substances; adding the crimes of possession of a controlled substance and use of a controlled substance in a public place; amending Section 12A.09.020 of the Seattle Municipal Code; and adding a new Section 3.28.141 to the Seattle Municipal Code.\n\n\n\nSummary and Background of the Legislation: This legislation results from a collaborative effort to identify a public health approach to the public safety impact of public use and possession of controlled substances. \n\n\n\nThe legislation makes the use or possession of controlled substances in a public place a gross misdemeanor in the City of Seattle. Earlier in 2023, the Washington state legislature passed 2E2SSB 5536, which makes the use or possession of controlled substances in a public place a gross misdemeanor in the state of Washington. Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 69.50.608 and RCW 35.22.208(35) require the penalty and disposition provisions of the City\u2019s criminal ordinances to be the same as provided for in state law. Adopting this legislation aligns the City\u2019s provisions with the newly enacted state provisions and allows the City (via the City Attorney\u2019s Office) to prosecute the use or possession of a controlled substance in a public place as a gross misdemeanor.\n\n\n\nImportantly, this legislation clarifies that diversion \u2013 pre-arrest, post-arrest, or pre-file \u2013 is the preferred approach when enforcing public use and possession offenses. It also includes a threat of harm standard to help guide police officer decision-making and to reduce the likelihood of arrest. Lastly, this legislation expressly adopts the diversion requirements outlined in 2E2SSB 5536, Sections 2, 9, and 10.\n\n\n\n2. CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM\n\nDoes this legislation create, fund, or amend a CIP Project? \t\t___ Yes _X_ No \n\n\n\n3. SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nDoes this legislation amend the Adopted Budget? \t\t\t___ Yes _X_ No\n\n\n\nDoes the legislation have other financial impacts to The City of Seattle that are not reflected in the above, including direct or indirect, short-term or long-term costs?\n\nThis legislation may increase the number of criminal charges filed in the Seattle Municipal Court.  A significant increase could eventually result in a need for additional resources in the City Attorney\u2019s Office, the Seattle Municipal Court, or an expansion of the City\u2019s contracted work with the King County Office of the Public Defender.\n\n\n\nThis legislation may also result in the need for additional investments in diversion systems, including at pre-arrest, arrest, pre-file, and post-file stages. This need will be explored by the diversion workgroup created as part of Mayor Harrell\u2019s Fentanyl Systems Work Group.\n\n\n\nAre there financial costs or other impacts of not implementing the legislation?\n\nWe are unaware of any direct financial impacts as a result of not implementing this legislation.\n\n\n\n4. OTHER IMPLICATIONS\n\nDoes this legislation affect any departments besides the originating department?  \n\nResources in the City Attorney\u2019s Office and Seattle Municipal Court may be needed for prosecution of a gross misdemeanor resulting from this legislation. HSD may also require additional funding to support increases to diversion programs.\n\n\n\nIs a public hearing required for this legislation?\n\nNo.\n\n\n\nIs publication of notice with The Daily Journal of Commerce and/or The Seattle Times required for this legislation?\n\nNo.\n\n\n\nDoes this legislation affect a piece of property?\n\nNo.\n\n\n\nPlease describe any perceived implication for the principles of the Race and Social Justice Initiative. Does this legislation impact vulnerable or historically disadvantaged communities? What is the Language Access plan for any communications to the public?\n\n\n\nHistorically in the United States, drug use and possession laws have disproportionately impacted BIPOC and other vulnerable communities.  This legislation does not require arrest or prosecution for the gross misdemeanors it creates, nor is its goal arrest, prosecution, or incarceration. To the contrary, it identifies diversion as the preferred approach when enforcing these laws. This legislation is intended as one of several tools available to public safety teams and other responders, but the goal is to connect people with recovery services.\n\n\n\nClimate Change Implications\n\nEmissions: Is this legislation likely to increase or decrease carbon emissions in a material way? \n\nNo.\n\n\n\nResiliency: Will the action(s) proposed by this legislation increase or decrease Seattle\u2019s resiliency (or ability to adapt) to climate change in a material way? If so, explain. If it is likely to decrease resiliency in a material way, describe what will or could be done to mitigate the effects.\n\nNo.\n\n\n\nIf this legislation includes a new initiative or a major programmatic expansion: What are the specific long-term and measurable goal(s) of the program? How will this legislation help achieve the program\u2019s desired goal(s)?\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n1\n\nTemplate last revised: December 13, 2022",

        "detail": "The city council meeting focused on discussing and potentially voting on a bill concerning drug possession in public places. Chair Lisa Herbold expressed anger and disappointment over insensitive messaging about a death in recently released body cam footage. Public comments covered topics such as harm reduction, racial disparities in diversion decisions, drug-free zones, the impact of crime and homelessness, and investment in programs supporting individuals affected by drugs. There were differing opinions on the proposed legislation, with some supporting it for public safety reasons and others opposing it for its potential negative impact on marginalized communities and lack of resources for treatment and diversion programs. The meeting highlighted the need for action to address drug use, crime, and homelessness in the city. The council also discussed a bill regarding data collection, with amendments proposed to address concerns about biased policing and officer discretion. Funding for diversion programs and concerns about budget gaps were also discussed. The council decided to wait on acting on the legislation until funding assurances are provided.

controlled substances for discussion and possible vote.\n\nWe'll now approve the agenda for our committee meeting.\n\nAny objections?\n\nSeeing and hearing no objections, today's agenda is adopted.\n\nBefore we move into public comment, I do want to just say a few words.\n\nI feel really compelled to address the recently released body cam footage and audio recording regarding careless and inhumane messaging about the death of Jahavni Kandula.\n\nAppreciate the remarks of Joel Merkel, co -chair of the Community Police Commission, who described this video as heartbreaking, shockingly insensitive, and as damaging to the trust that the department is trying to build with Seattle communities.\n\nWhile I'm angry and disappointed to hear the way that this detective talked about a fatal collision, I'm appreciative that the accountability system is working to find and daylight this type of culture within the department so that we can continue to push to shift and reform the police department.\n\nAs horrifying as this conversation was to hear, I want to also say that I'm thankful to police department employees who discovered this and appropriately escalated these comments through their chain of command to the chief's office, and thankful that Chief Diaz referred the matter to OPA for investigation as the accountability ordinance prescribes.\n\nAnd as we are looking to hire more officers, I think keeping our focus on the types of individuals who see their work as guardians, not warriors, and working to help the department to shift our culture, to seek support, and retain officers with an interest in protecting human life and upholding the peace and well -being of our city.\n\nWith that, we will transition into public comment.\n\nI will moderate the public comment period in the following manner.\n\nEach speaker will be given one minute to speak because of the large number of speakers that we have signed up.\n\nI will alternate between virtual and in -person public commenters.\n\nI will call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council's website in the sign -in form.\n\nIf you've not yet registered to speak, but you'd like to, you can sign up before the end of the public comment session.\n\nOnce I call a speaker's name, if you are using the virtual option, you will hear a prompt and once you've heard that prompt, we ask that you press star six to unmute yourself.\n\nPlease begin by speaking.\n\nPlease begin speaking by stating your name and the item which you are addressing.\n\nAnd speakers will hear a chime when you have 10 seconds left of the allotted time.\n\nOnce you hear that chime, we ask that you begin to wrap up your comments.\n\nIf you do not end your comments at the end of the allotted time provided, unfortunately the speaker's mic will have to be muted after 10 seconds to allow us to hear from the next speaker.\n\nOnce you've completed your public comment, we ask that you disconnect from the line.\n\nAnd if you plan to continue following the meeting, we ask that you do so via the Seattle channel or the listening options that are listed on the agenda.\n\nWe've got 50 people signed up for public comment so far, 10 folks who are signed up virtually and 31 who are signed up in person.\n\nI will alternate between the in -person speakers and the online speakers.\n\nAnd we'll start with some in -person speakers.\n\nLet's start with Tara Moss followed by Latanya Sevier.\n\nGood morning, council members.\n\nIs this one on?\n\nAll right.\n\nI am co -executive director of Purpose, Dignity, Action.\n\nWe operate CoLEAD, which is an intensive case management wing of LEAD Diversion Services.\n\nAnd we also provide project management for LEAD citywide.\n\nThe services offered through LEAD are based on principles of harm reduction because that approach is both humane and often most effective in engaging people on a long recovery journey.\n\nBut while in LEAD, we meet people where they are at and we don't leave them there.\n\nThe goal is to support individuals over a long arc of change that reflects how complicated and nonlinear recovery is for most people.\n\nWe offer a decade of experience showing that it is possible to combine case management based in harm reduction in partnership with the police and prosecutors to accomplish profound transformation for individuals and to benefit neighborhoods.\n\nWe appreciate so much the vote of confidence in the partnership with Mayor Harrell's proposed ordinance reflects.\n\nAt the same time, discretionary decisions to divert people to community -based services must always be scrutinized to ensure that we aren't inadvertently compounding racial disparity with the choices of who to divert and the quality of care provided.\n\nWe're really pleased to see that the proposed ordinance requires regular data.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou can follow up with your written comments.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nWe've got Latonya Sevier.\n\nAnd after Latonya Sevier, I'm just noting that we have a former elected official in the room and I'd like to observe the courtesy of having representative Don Mason follow Latonya Sevier.\n\nLatonya, I'm so sorry.\n\nThank you.\n\nMy name is Latonya and I'm a black non -binary renter in D2.\n\nI'm here to ask again, I'm here again, telling you all again to reject this new criminal, change to the criminal code to prosecute drug possessions and public drug use.\n\nLet's visit San Francisco to see how their war on drugs is going.\n\nIn San Francisco, overdose deaths decreased in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThen they got a new district attorney who vowed to take a law and order approach to the opioid overdose epidemic, just like Seattle City Attorney Ann Davison and Council Member Sarah Nelson and Alex Peterson.\n\nSan Francisco's new war on drugs is going very badly.\n\nIn December of 2022, the San Francisco District Attorney shut down a critical day shelter and service provider in the Tenderloin.\n\nAt the end of May, the city launched an initiative to arrest people suspected of using drugs in public.\n\nThe result, drug -related deaths have surged by 41%.\n\nA third of the overdose victims were black, despite black people making up only 5 % of the city's population.\n\nVote now.\n\nWoo!\n\nWoo!\n\nWoo!\n\nWoo!\n\nFollowing Dawn Mason, we'll have Austin Haynes.\n\nGood morning, and thank you, Council Member Herbold, for having this hearing.\n\nAnd my name is Dawn Mason.\n\nI'm a former state representative.\n\nI represented the 37th District, and I'm here to speak about the children and to shame you as a council.\n\nIn all of your amendments, in all of your decision -making and problem -solving, you never considered the children.\n\nYou have allowed this city to surround our children who are going to school every day with illicit drugs, fencing.\n\nI'm speaking right now.\n\nI spent time over here at 12th and King Street.\n\nWe have a high school there.\n\nAnd what you have done is normed the worst, most egregious behavior a child can see.\n\nI'm asking you to be a hero today.\n\nBe a hero for the children.\n\nGo back to the drawing board and draw into this legislation drug -free zones.\n\nThere's a social construct that make people think that we already have drug -free zones, but we do not.\n\nIt's not the law.\n\nMake it the law that no one will consume a new drug against them like a drug in front of our children.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOur next speaker is Austin Haynes, and Austin will be followed by Deontay Dampers.\n\nHello, I took time off work here in downtown Seattle to testify.\n\nI'm a District 2 resident and homeowner.\n\nMy wife and I are expecting our first child.\n\nWe have lived the results of defunding the police and giving addicts, criminals, and homeless folks the ability to ruin a great city.\n\nWe have witnessed a murder a few hundred feet from our front door when we lived at the residences above Target.\n\nWe're scared to live here.\n\nMy wife and I have, oh, no.\n\nThis morning on a city of Seattle Street, we found the fuel tank of my wife's car drilled.\n\nThis $1 ,000 plus expense we can absorb.\n\nSome of my neighbors cannot, which means if it happened to them, they could slide into homelessness, adding to the doom loop.\n\nMy wife and I have options, and we may leave unless we see substantial progress on crime, homelessness, and open -air drug use.\n\nWe also both vote on every ballot.\n\nI'm in favor of this legislation.\n\nI implore every one of you to have a few conversations with folks who have experienced addiction and have now been clean and sober for a couple years, and ask them if they feel the laissez -faire attitude towards dealing with addiction is the right path.\n\nI've spoken with hundreds.\n\nI am certain you will hear a resounding no.\n\nThank you.\n\nGo ahead and leave.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Deontay Damper, followed by Sean Blackwell.\n\nGood morning, council.\n\nToday, I come in peace.\n\nUsually, I am ready to go at you about the war on drugs tactics.\n\nUsually, I'm really just saying how problematic you can be, but I think today we can be able to meet somewhere in the middle.\n\nThere's 27 million that's coming out of here that I hope that you can be able to provide, to not only invest into some of these programs that are out here, such as REACH and COLEAD, that are out here in the community.\n\nI think that as council members, as opposed to listening to these negative comments of stigmatizing our community members that are impacted by drugs, that you can also go out here and meet the people that are impacted, because a lot of them are unhoused by money that was promised from county and city council.\n\nI just hope that at this point of time, we can be able to meet each other in the middle.\n\nAnd that's all the hell I got for y 'all today.\n\nThank you.\n\nNext speaker is Sean Blackwell.\n\nAfter Sean Blackwell, we've got Barb Wilson.\n\nHey, good morning, council.\n\nI project manage and lead in East Precinct Cap Hill, downtown, also project managed Third Avenue project.\n\nI hear from desperate owners, operators, and businesses every day imploring us to reduce public safety issues in the community.\n\nMy entire focus is on increasing public safety for the entire community, hopefully in an upstream proactive way.\n\nWhen LEAD has enough case management and housing resources, we're able to effectively intervene.\n\nWe're able to increase public safety and we're able to, and the community feels that.\n\nWe within LEAD are absolutely committed to fulfilling the council's ordinance and fulfilling the vision in a really effective way.\n\nAnd we commend the mayor for creating a framework for diversion that has a lot of potential to be the most progressive and highly impactful ordinance in the country.\n\nWe also greatly appreciate the amendment of council members Mosqueda and Herbal.\n\nAnd I'll finish, I'll end with that, thanks.\n\nOur next speaker is Barb Wilson and Barb will be followed by Lars Erickson.\n\nHi, my name's Barb Wilson.\n\nI lead local government affairs for Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft believes major employers have an important role addressing these important issues for our community.\n\nAnd through partnership, philanthropy, and policy, we've worked closely with our communities across the region to support strong, vibrant, safe neighborhoods.\n\nWe urge you today to vote in favor of this legislation and we agree with this balance between law enforcement and treatment.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Lars Erickson and Lars will be followed by Adrian Meag perhaps, Lars.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMy name is Lars Erickson and I'm here providing testimony on behalf of the 2 ,500 members of the Seattle Metro Chamber and the Downtown Seattle Association.\n\nToday, as we have since May, we are urging the council to adopt an ordinance aligning local law with recently passed state legislation regarding drug use and possession to address the crisis and harm caused by fentanyl and other illegal drugs in our community.\n\nAnd we agree with the intent of legislation under consideration today.\n\nHelp people get treatment and enforce the law.\n\nAs you deliberate and discuss, we also hope that the final legislation passed today will be simple and effective.\n\nAnd we expect the practical, real -world application of the law to make good on the intent.\n\nPassage of legislation today is one step.\n\nThe measures of success will be that in the coming months, we will see more people in treatment, fewer people on the streets, and far fewer overdoses.\n\nWe urge you to keep those tangible outcomes in mind as you deliberate today.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Adrian, I believe it's Meek?\n\nMeese, thank you so much.\n\nFollowed by Reverend Harriet Walden.\n\nOkay.\n\nHi, my name is Adrian Meese and I am the founder and CEO of Fentanyl Awareness.\n\nAnd our mission is to educate the communities on the dangers of fentanyl and drug overdose through our events, our events books, and outreach programs that we pursue today.\n\nBe that I lost 11 people, I'm trying to make a change in the community and put a stop to the end of fentanyl and drug use and drug overdose.\n\nAnd I want to make a change by rehab programs and facilities like that, man, because it can happen to your mother, it can happen to your father, your sister, your brother, everybody's vulnerable to the dangers of fentanyl and drug overdose.\n\nSo help us stop this problem today, you know?\n\nHelp us stop this problem because if we can't, I mean, if we don't do it, then who will?\n\nAnd that's all I'm gonna say.\n\nThank y 'all.\n\nFentanyl Awareness.\n\nAll right.\n\nOur next speaker is Reverend Harriet Walden followed by Brent Haberman.\n\nGood morning.\n\nThank you, I'm Reverend Walden speaking for Mother's Police Accountability Day.\n\nAnd personally, I had a fentanyl exposure, almost died.\n\nI was ashamed to talk about it when I was here before.\n\nI'm 77 years old and never been involved with drugs.\n\nI think we have a real problem in Seattle and I think it's time to do what's hard.\n\nSometimes we have to do what's hard.\n\nAnd I mean, there was nothing wrong with the state law.\n\nI mean, the state ordinance, the state law was, I mean, it's not the war on drugs.\n\nWar on drugs was a felony and people see it's a felony.\n\nThere's a major difference between a felony and a gross misdemeanor.\n\nAnd I think people don't understand the difference between those two.\n\nSo I guess this will be a start, but it's not what it could be.\n\nIt's time for Seattle to really want to do what's hard.\n\nI mean, sometimes you have to have, I mean, if you raise children, and especially boys, you have to have some place where you're willing to do what's hard.\n\nAnd I think that mothers would stand behind the city council doing what's hard.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Brent Haberman, followed by Sam Wolf.\n\nHello, council.\n\nBrent Haberman here.\n\nI live at 9th and Virginia, and I've been a Seattle resident since 1986.\n\nI'm here today to support this measure, CB 12645, for many reasons with the short time period.\n\nI'll just give you a couple examples as to why.\n\nFirst of all, I have seen the degradation of our streets in the last four or five years to become such a serious issue because of the drug dealers on the street, open air and able to sell, as well as the drug users that are harming themselves.\n\nSo we're not taking care of anybody, actually.\n\nAnd so this bill should hopefully help that situation because people don't want to live here, want to move away.\n\nYou're losing a tax base because of the business to help everyone else.\n\nBelieve in stigmatizing anybody.\n\nI don't believe in discriminating against anybody, but I believe in safety in this city, and that's your major responsibility.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nNext, we have Sam Wolf, and then we're gonna move to some of our virtual speakers.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMy name is Sam Wolf.\n\nI'm a senior project manager for the LEAD program.\n\nI coordinate LEAD diversion services and case conferencing in North Seattle, and I have the honor of working with community leaders in the CID and Little Saigon to design street -based interventions for drug -related crime in their neighborhood.\n\nPDA appreciates the mayor's approach to this ordinance, which emphasizes diversion to care.\n\nThat is a clear advance beyond the state legislation.\n\nWe also deeply appreciate the substitute by Herbold and Lewis that would establish a standing behavioral health advisory committee.\n\nOur community has some of the most committed and advanced practitioners of modern recovery in the nation.\n\nTheir insights often don't make it into policy conversations.\n\nThe Lewis and Herbold proposal means that we would have the chance to tighten up our diversion and care systems, which is much needed if we're going to improve conditions on our streets and outcomes for the people that we're working with.\n\nThe mayor's fentanyl task force is convening this fall and will be a good start, but we're glad to see the proposal to make community input and expertise permanently available to public policy.\n\nThank you.\n\nActually, I'm going to take a few more people in person while I'm pulling up the online sign -up sheet.\n\nNext, we have Collin Lamb, and Collin will be followed by Jacob Michalak.\n\nMy name is Collin Lamb.\n\nI am a case manager with the Downtown Emergency Service Center, and I'm here to urge you all to vote against this measure because this directly targets the clients that I work with every day.\n\nAnd look, I know that nobody wants to see, you know, somebody sparking up on the bus or something.\n\nI have seen that myself, but I also understand that the people who use the bus to get to the bus stop and use these drugs are not the problem.\n\nIt is a lack of support.\n\nIt is a lack of harm -reduction programs that are...\n\nSorry, my throat's a little messed up.\n\nBut, you know, we need to fund harm -reduction and housing -first -based approaches to this problem.\n\nOtherwise, it's not going to go away.\n\nA new war on drugs is not going to fix it.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd, yeah, just vote against this bill, please.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker after Jacob Michalak is Kate Rubin.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMy name is Jacob Michalak, and I've been a homeowner in the Central District for the past 32 years.\n\nThank you very much for this opportunity to speak to you.\n\nMy entire career has been focused on housing and services for people living within the city.\n\nI've been involved in the fight against HIV and experiencing homelessness.\n\nI was the lead author of the first comprehensive plan to end homelessness in King County.\n\nAnd more recently, a suite of resources developed for the US Department of Housing and Urban Development titled Homecoming, Life After Incarceration.\n\nTime and again over the past 40 years, efforts by local, state, and federal governments to solve substance use issues through criminalization and enhanced policing have failed.\n\nAnd these policies have disproportionately impacted people of color, especially those with African -American heritage.\n\nThe proven solutions, as my colleagues are stating, center around sincere, robust investments in person -centered care, housing, employment, education, food security, and family stability.\n\nAll of our money should be going there.\n\nI am opposed to CB120645.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Kate Rubin, and Kate will be followed by Dennis Sills.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMy name is Kate Rubin.\n\nI live in the city of Seattle.\n\nI'm calling today to urge you to vote no on the racist and deadly Council Bill 120645 that criminalizes simple drug possession and drug use.\n\nThis regressive measure takes us right back to the failed war on drugs harming public health and targeting marginalized communities.\n\nStable housing is a prerequisite for effective substance abuse treatment.\n\nHousing First is the evidence -based, most effective approach to ending homelessness, backed by multiple national studies.\n\nWe are heading into budget season, and we are in a budget deficit.\n\nInstead of addressing the fentanyl crisis at its roots, investing in Housing First, this bill will drain our limited city resources, disproportionately harm our black, brown, and indigenous and unhoused neighbors, and overcrowd our already unhealthy jails.\n\nIt's rooted in white supremacy culture.\n\nDo the right thing and vote no on Council Bill 120645.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Dennis Sills, and Dennis will be followed by Michael Malini.\n\nChair Herbold and committee members, thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment.\n\nMy name is Dennis Sills, and I work at Plymouth Housing, a PSH provider to more than 1 ,200 chronically homeless adults in Seattle.\n\nPlymouth is a Housing First provider, which means we seek to meet residents where they are when they enter our housing.\n\nWe practice harm reduction strategies with achieving housing stability.\n\nWe are partnering with the city on a contingency management program to encourage recovery.\n\nWe support the amendments introduced today by Council Member Herbold and Lewis, and Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nPlymouth is committed to ending homelessness, and decades of experience shows support for those with substance use disorder can lead to housing stability.\n\nWe also know that justice system involvement can contribute to housing instability, so we appreciate that the council is considering alternatives like LEAD.\n\nWe also recognize that there must be an avenue to direct individuals to treatment when they are a threat to others, and when they will not enter treatment voluntarily.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Michael Malini, followed by Carissa Knight.\n\nHello, my name is Michael Malini.\n\nI'm a resident in District 3, and I'm calling to ask you to, again, reject the proposed legislation that would expand the city's criminal code to prosecute drug possession and public drug use.\n\nWe have decades of evidence that incarceration doesn't prevent overdose, nor give people the help they need.\n\nAny adoption of this law would increase overdoses, deaths, and racial disparities in arrest, jail time, and overdoses.\n\nThe proposed bill will bring us back to regressive and racist policies instead of moving toward evidence -based, effective, and more compassionate approaches.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOur next speaker is Carissa Knight.\n\nCarissa will be followed by Jason Walsh.\n\nHi, can you hear me?\n\nYes, we can.\n\nGreat, hi, I'm Carissa.\n\nI live in District 4, and I want improved public safety for everyone, and so I oppose this new war on drugs legislation.\n\nThrough regular volunteer mutual aid work, I've met several community members, some of whom use drugs, including someone who shared how much shame they felt about it, how it's so hard and painful to quit, and that sometimes that's what gets you through a day of dehumanization and stress.\n\nAnother person said that she did mess to stay up all night because she was so scared of people coming into her tent.\n\nAnd what I want for them is safety, professional care, resource community support, safe housing, and not a policy that could be even more deadly than the drug use itself.\n\nI'm curious why criminalization is our answer when it seems to defy expert recommendations to prioritize a public health approach with prevention and early intervention rather than punitive measures.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Jason Walsh, and Jason will be followed by Brandy Flood.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMy name is Jason.\n\nI'm a resident of B2, and I'm here to call on council to unequivocally say no to CB -120645, this new war on drugs.\n\nWhile I was a master's in public health student at the University of Washington, I worked with Snohomish Health District to develop a substance use disorder treatment matrix.\n\nThe county wanted to improve connectivity of health services and get people into treatment, not into cells.\n\nI learned that substance use disorder grew out of poverty.\n\nIt grew out of pain.\n\nIt grew out of trauma.\n\nI learned that as we decrease healthcare options and conversely increase the penalties for use when you choose to criminalize substance use, this perpetuates poverty.\n\nIt increases stigma.\n\nIt increases trauma.\n\nIt increases harm, which can lead to increased substance use.\n\nCriminalization doesn't break the cycle.\n\nIt perpetuates it.\n\nSo what is your real charge here as a council member?\n\nWhat is your mission?\n\nIs it to serve others or is it to sentence them?\n\nSubstance use disorder is an illness, and we treat illness with healthcare, not handcuffs.\n\nNo to a new war on drugs.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Brandy Flood, and Brandy will be followed by Catherine Stanford.\n\nThank you, Council Member Herbold.\n\nMy name is Brandy Flood.\n\nI'm a resident of the Rainier Beach neighborhood, and a homeowner.\n\nI'm also Director of Community Justice for the REACH Program, and I manage the contracts for LEAD, and I work with LEAD, Co -LEAD to work in this population.\n\nMy case managers serve folks that are being diverted to care.\n\nI agree with Reverend Walden.\n\nThis is not the war on drugs.\n\nThis is something different.\n\nThis is their version to care, and I appreciate the mayor's approach.\n\nIn order for this to actually work, there has to be sufficient resources to divert people to, which is why I appreciate Council Member Herbold and Louis's Behavioral Health Task Force and the Fentanyl Task Force that is coming up.\n\nMy staff and I walk the streets of downtown all the time.\n\nThey're riddled with black and brown people struggling from drug use that need to be connected to services, but we don't have adequate services to connect people to.\n\nSo I urge the council, if they're gonna push this for adequate resources to connect people to adequate treatment, housing, shelter, mental health, better crisis services.\n\nIf I had somebody in my office right now who needed to be in treatment or crisis, it would almost take me too much to get them in because there's so many systematic barriers to doing that.\n\nIt shouldn't be that way.\n\nWhen people need and ask for help, we should be able to do it immediately.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Catherine Stanford, and Catherine will be followed by Brian Cannon.\n\nHi, and thank you to Herbold and committee members for the opportunity to speak.\n\nAnd speaking on behalf of the building owners and managers of Seattle King County, BOMA, I also would like to note that personally, I have been engaged in downtown Seattle, both at the market and with my own business for over 30 years.\n\nAnd BOMA has been significantly engaged in public safety issues since before the pandemic.\n\nIt is critical to vote this bill out of committee and onto the full council.\n\nThe delay has cost us in human suffering and continued issues with open air drug dealing on our streets.\n\nA commercial real estate industry has been working hard to help revitalize downtown.\n\nPublic drug use is one barrier to attracting tenants, leaving us with less foot traffic and more empty storefronts downtown.\n\nIt's sort of this endless cycle.\n\nWe support the fact that BOMA will include measures to provide services and treatment options and diversion programs.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOur next speaker speaking remotely is Brian Cannon and Brian will be followed by Nicholas Jeffries.\n\nHi, my name is Brian Cannon.\n\nI oversee the community safety and hospitality ambassador program for the Metropolitan Improvement District.\n\nMy comments today are in support of the ordinance.\n\nAs we've seen, the fentanyl crisis has continued to worsen and cause harm to individuals and the community.\n\nOver the past year, our ambassador teams have administered Narcan to people over 180 times.\n\nAnd in the past week alone, they've administered it seven times.\n\nOne key component of this ordinance is the focus on diversion.\n\nI also believe that this is an opportunity to increase resources for existing programs such as LEAD and CoLEAD.\n\nMy team has worked with LEAD for the past decade and we've seen the LEAD program have a high level of success by providing stability for many people who've suffered with addiction and behavioral health issues.\n\nTheir approach has become a national model.\n\nUnfortunately, the program is at capacity and currently has to turn away many candidates who would be a good fit.\n\nI ask you to pass the ordinance and to provide resources needed to scale the LEAD program to meet the increased demand for diversion and services.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Nicholas Jeffries.\n\nAnd Nicholas will be followed by Randy Green.\n\nHey, how are you doing today?\n\nMy name is Nicholas Jeffries and I currently work with vacating and expunging criminal records.\n\nAnd I vote to vote no on this legislation because the money spent implementing this program can be used to create upstream solutions versus looking at the downstream impacts.\n\nIt's time to start funding programs that actually help people get into housing, help people access resources and help people manifest their greatest self.\n\nFrom firsthand experience, I could see the criminalization of drug usage, more specifically, giving people gross misdemeanors, really helps put, it puts barriers in place of getting help, it puts barriers in place of accessing employment.\n\nAnd as we know, with the rent hike and how much everything costs in Washington, if you don't have stable employment and don't make a livable wage, we're continuing to perpetuate this vicious, vicious cycle.\n\nAnd I think it's time for the community that we've worked together to help everybody in this city, to help everybody in this county manifest their greatest self.\n\nThank you for letting me speak.\n\nHave an amazing day.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Randy Green.\n\nRandy is showing it's not present right now.\n\nSo we'll move down to Matthew Offenbacher.\n\nAnd Matthew will be followed by Isabel Nguyen.\n\nHi, council.\n\nMy name is Matthew Offenbacher.\n\nI'm a homeowner in district three and a small business owner in district one.\n\nAnd I really can't believe that we're here again just a few months after you heard hours upon hours of testimony about the harm this legislation will cause.\n\nAdding drug possession and public drug use to our criminal code will be an ineffectual, racist, expensive, and deadly response to a horrifying public health crisis.\n\nNow, I can hear some of you thinking, but this bill is different.\n\nIt's all about harm reduction and diversion and case management.\n\nIt even says somewhere in there that the war on drugs was very, very bad for black people.\n\nWe are not fooled and don't fool yourselves.\n\nThis is a bad legislation.\n\nSo much of it is hand -waving promises and magical thinking.\n\nJust trust us.\n\nWhile at the actionable heart of it, it will permanently add to the city code a path for SPD to arrest and jail people with substance use disorders and for the city attorney to prosecute with the predictable effect of accelerating the already devastating loss of life the epidemic has caused.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Isabel Nguyen followed by Andrea Suarez.\n\nHello and good morning, council and the listening public.\n\nI live in D4 and I voted in D4 for the last 12 years.\n\nYou are set to vote again on amendments for CB 120645 that will increase incarceration and place vulnerable individuals under threat of incarceration, fines and police violence.\n\nYou are voting to have SPD a department that had the largest amount of sworn officers at the January 6th insurrection at our nation's Capitol.\n\nSix of our sworn officers were in DC attempting to tort our legal proceedings for the 2020 president of the United States.\n\nYou are saying that you want these same individuals and that same department to combat our drug crisis?\n\nThat same department where the VP of SPOG on a hot mic invalidating the significance of life, Giovanni Cadula, who was a grad student set to graduate with her master's in information systems was not worth more than, quote, 1 ,000 and a limited value, end quote.\n\nIf we have members of a department behind closed doors invalidating the life of a grad student, how much more do they invalidate the lives of those they're supposed to help and aid during these drug interactions?\n\nAre you voting to imbue and empower a department and more resources to murder Seattle residences?\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Andrea Suarez.\n\nAnd after Andrea speaks, we'll move back to in -person public commenters.\n\nGood morning.\n\nThis is Andrea Suarez, founder of We Heart Seattle.\n\nI have three years of practical experience, boots on the ground providing outreach and cleaning of encampments, removing a million pounds of debris, 20 ,000 dirty needles, and actually nine now passed bodies and hosting dozens of vigils.\n\nAnd I don't have a lot of numbers today or studies or committees, but only to urge the council to pass this ordinance to save lives now.\n\nNo more lives should pass because we're in this meeting.\n\nThe death toll is on all of our watches right now as we talk about this.\n\nI'm not here for political reasons or ideological reasons.\n\nI just want to save lives.\n\nIn Belltown, we had another shooting last night at an open air drug scene on 3rd and Blanchard where open air use of drugs are permitted.\n\nIf we would stop permitting that, we could reduce the loss of lives.\n\nAnd we need to stop treating people like hospice patients by barely keeping them alive through failed harm reduction efforts.\n\nWe need intervention outreach.\n\nYour next speaker is Teresa Lamb and Teresa will be followed by Julia Buck.\n\nThere are no facts to support that this will do anything but deeply harm marginalized communities.\n\nAnd you all know this.\n\nThere is no budget to support this and there is no plan, no care, compassion or commitment to do anything other than imprison our most vulnerable citizens.\n\nIf you really want to make positive changes in the city, stop pushing for inhumane laws like this and show the citizens, all citizens of Seattle that you are looking for real solutions, not pandering to businesses and election cycles.\n\nWork with the organizations that know what the needs are and know these vulnerable communities instead of putting your efforts into gaslighting everyone and passing something that you know will cost lives.\n\nIf you do support this inhumane law, don't pretend to support the efforts of these organizations that are honestly working to end homelessness and working with people with substance use disorder.\n\nYou can't support this law and claim to support these compassionate efforts at the same time.\n\nOur next speaker is Julia Buck and Julia will be followed by Peter Condit.\n\nGood morning, council.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak.\n\nI am here because I am not in favor of the bill currently under consideration.\n\nAnd I wanted to just briefly place it in a bit of a larger context because similar bills are happening all over the country in all 50 states, the red state of Texas and the blue state of Washington are having special sessions about the need to increase criminalization.\n\nAnd I think that there is an economic purpose to that.\n\nThe market of consumer goods made from prison labor is $11 billion.\n\nAnd I think that there is the opportunity to re -industrialize this country using involuntary labor because American workers are very expensive, which is a result of American health care being expensive.\n\nI would like to encourage you not to pursue this economic policy.\n\nThank you.\n\nGoodbye.\n\nOur next speaker is Peter Condit and Peter will be followed by Reza Arashi.\n\nHello, council members.\n\nMy name is Peter Condit and I live in district six.\n\nI ask that council reject the new war on drugs bill.\n\nDo y 'all know how to identify structural racism?\n\nDespite lavish use of the word diversion, the bill would create a new law that can be enforced.\n\nAnd despite purported good intentions, the war on drugs and SPD in particular have a record of racist and deadly outcomes.\n\nThat's structural racism.\n\nIf you need more, just yesterday, we heard a police conversation that took place after an SPD officer killed Janavi Kandula while speeding to an overdose.\n\nDetective auditor was laughing at Janavi's death.\n\nSPD is full of harmful people who prioritize their oversized paychecks over the very lives of Seattleites.\n\nStop involving cops in public health.\n\nStop giving them money and power.\n\nCouncil members, if you're discouraged by that recording, stand against this legislation.\n\nBe a force for good instead of supporting this malicious bill.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Reza Marashi, followed by Joy Abbott.\n\nHello, council members.\n\nMy name is Reza Marashi.\n\nI'm director of government affairs for Kilroy Realty Corporation and board chair of the Metropolitan Improvement District.\n\nI'm here to urge you to vote in favor of this council bill, a critical public safety measure for the city of Seattle.\n\nMy request to you today is to ask you The bill currently reflects the strong majority opinion of Seattleites.\n\nWe know from multiple rounds of public opinion polling that over 80 % of Seattle voters believe that restoring a safe and welcoming environment downtown will bring back residents, workers, and visitors and create the momentum needed to put downtown on a sustained path to recovery.\n\nSince August of 2022, the MID program has administered Narcan to 191 people.\n\nJuly 2023 has been our highest month so far with Narcan being administered to 25 people.\n\nSadly, the crisis is only getting worse.\n\nThat's why I believe this legislation is a critical step in addressing these issues by providing much needed resources for treatment and diversion programs.\n\nTo that end, please make sure that community -based resources that have demonstrated success are renewed and expanded.\n\nThose programs include Third Avenue Project, LEAD, and CoLEAD.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd I would just like to say that these chambers are a place for the democratic process to work for everyone.\n\nSo please, your comments are for public comment.\n\nI do not want any disruption of speakers because that hurts the ability of all of us to participate in this process.\n\nOur next speaker is Jay Abbott and Jay will be followed by Susie Morris.\n\nDo we have a Joy Abbott or a Jay Abbott?\n\nIf we do not, a Jay or a Joy Abbott and in the topic, I'm sorry.\n\nI'm Susie Morris.\n\nOkay, somebody who wanted to address issues about I'm assuming public safety and the ID.\n\nNot seeing anybody.\n\nShe's not here.\n\nGo ahead, Susie.\n\nShe had to leave.\n\nThank you.\n\nHi, I'm Susie Morris.\n\nI am a resident of District Two and I've lived in Mount Baker neighborhood for 25 years.\n\nI am also an EVP for Lowe Enterprises, which is a housing developer in the Seattle area.\n\nWe have a 550 unit project in Yesler Terrace that was recently built and we are under lease up right now.\n\nWe have, of that project, 26 and a half percent is affordable and the rest is market rate.\n\nYesler Terrace is a great example of what the city is doing to provide housing, but it's getting really hard with crime that's happening in Little Saigon.\n\nThere's been such a, you know, there was such a great effort by the police department.\n\nLots of things cleaned up and then it went away again.\n\nIt's really bad and we're losing residents.\n\nPeople are afraid to move in.\n\nPeople are moving out and something needs to change.\n\nI'm in support of this movement.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Ann Lyons and Ann will be followed by Mary Ann Christie.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak.\n\nI'm a retired teacher and I'm here as a mother.\n\nI have three friends who have lost children to drug overdose.\n\nOur state leads the nation in increase in overdose fatalities.\n\nI urge the council to act.\n\nI think we all want the same thing here, which is for people to be able to pursue a happy and healthy life, but what we're doing now is not working.\n\nAnd I support the bill.\n\nI know it's imperfect, but we need change.\n\nI've lived in this city for almost 30 years and I'm really worried about what is happening in our community and I just am begging you to act.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Mary Ann Christie.\n\nMy name's Mary Ann Christie.\n\nI live downtown and I'm here to support this public safety ordinance.\n\nAs a resident of downtown, I'm deeply concerned about public safety issues.\n\nI walk by and through drug markets every day.\n\nI'm away from my house to the drug store, which has got everything behind bars and locked up because of so much theft and the danger of just being working in that place.\n\nI think this legislation is a critical step in addressing issues by providing much needed resources for treatment and diversion programs.\n\nI want to make sure also that the council supports community -based resources that have demonstrated success and those programs include the Third Avenue Project, LEAD and CoLEAD.\n\nSo I urge you to vote in favor of this legislation, which will make our city a safer and healthier place for everyone.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nMoving back to virtual public comment, we'll hear next from Ramon Hernandez followed by Nick Jeffries.\n\nGood morning, council members.\n\nMy name is Ramon Hernandez.\n\nI work for LEAD.\n\nI am a South Precinct Project Manager working with community members, business organizations to resolve public safety issues.\n\nWe're excited about the mayor's and the council members' efforts to continue to guarantee information gathered on racial disparities and arrest, booking, prosecution.\n\nThe only way to guarantee that people who have historically had harsher responses to drug -related problems are included and benefit from the greater use of diversion is to do this.\n\nThe drug use policy, possession policy has the potential to be one of the best policies in the nation, and it can only fulfill its promises if we allocate the sufficient funds for services to be provided for care for those who are diverted.\n\nLEAD diversion services, they're evidence -based, highly effective without sufficient funding to increase diversion programs such as this.\n\nThese encouraged statements to MP, they can only frustrate and disappoint the community members who are here today in response to some of the public safety issues that they're encountering.\n\nEnacting this legislation alone is not sufficient.\n\nWe must adapt as the drug supply.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker, Nick Jeffries, is showing as not present.\n\nIf that changes before we're done public comment, I will come back to Nick.\n\nSimilarly with Shavonna Gaylor, also showing as not present.\n\nWe'll go down to Liam Nold, and Liam will be followed by Cody Zalewski.\n\nHi, my name is Liam Nold, and I'm calling to urge you to vote no on this ordinance.\n\nYou already heard testimony regarding how forcing people into drug treatment without addressing the underlying conditions that let them there does not work and increases overdose deaths.\n\nBeyond this, it gives police increased discretion to harass and enact violence against BIPOC and unhoused people.\n\nWe know this bill will disproportionately be enforced against BIPOC people, so please reject this bill and instead invest in harm reduction that is not attached to the deadly criminal punishment system.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Cody Zalewski, and Cody will be followed by Chris McKay.\n\nHello, council.\n\nThis is Cody Zalewski, resident of District Four.\n\nRecriminalizing drugs will push the fentanyl crisis out of sight of the general public, but it won't save lives.\n\nI get that voters want to see you doing something, but this is sweeping the problem under the rug at the behest of right -wing talk show hosts who live on the East Side.\n\nYou know this, and I know you know this because we've both heard the same stories from the same people struggling with addiction on the OEIR task force.\n\nPlease don't make life worse for people already struggling with substance abuse after being a progressive leader on drug law in the past.\n\nVote no on passing this out of the committee.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Chris McKay, and Chris will be followed by Aiden Carroll.\n\nChris McKay?\n\nI see you're with us.\n\nDoes it look like you're on mute?\n\nCan you hit star six if you haven't already?\n\nStar six, please.\n\nThere you go.\n\nAll right, so we're going to go ahead and we'll give you one more try.\n\nChris, we might need to come back to you.\n\nWe'll give you one more try.\n\nWe're not hearing you.\n\nStar six.\n\nAll right, I'm going to take another.\n\nI'm hitting star.\n\nThere you go, there you go.\n\nWe got you.\n\nOh, good, sorry.\n\nI kept hitting it.\n\nSorry about that.\n\nGood morning, council.\n\nThanks for allowing me to testify.\n\nMy name's Chris McKay.\n\nI'm the executive director of the West Seattle Junction Association.\n\nFor the past year, we've seen escalating drug use in our small park called Junction Plaza Park.\n\nPretty much been taken over by a handful of men who hang out there, threaten people, and do drugs openly.\n\nI have seen them offer drugs to teens, yell at people, and vandalize the park.\n\nJust last Saturday, I saw a man in the bus stop smoking up.\n\nThere were families everywhere.\n\nAlso, the apartment complex next to it is occupied by seniors who literally call me regularly to tell me what they're seeing and to let me know that they're terrified to use the park.\n\nMerchants call me regularly to describe how open drug use has negatively affected their businesses in a variety of ways.\n\nI receive calls from residents as well who are still scared and threatened.\n\nIt's shocking to me that in an effort to support the percentage of struggling individuals, we hold the rest of the city hostage.\n\nI'm asking the council to support this legislation addressing this chronic issue, and more importantly, to support organizations such as Lead & Reach, who work closely with my organization to help people who are struggling and make our public spaces safer.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Aiden Carroll, and Aiden is showing is not present.\n\nSo our last virtual public commenter that is showing is present is BJ Last.\n\nI will, after returning to the in -person public commenters and finishing that list, I will go back and check to see if any of the folks who've signed up virtually, but are listed as not present are present.\n\nBut we'll hear from BJ Last next.\n\nAnd then going back to in -person, we've got Suzanne Kotz next up on deck.\n\nBJ.\n\nHi, my name is BJ Last.\n\nI'm a homeowner in Ballard, and I'm calling once again to ask you once again to reject CB120645, if there's absolutely no such thing as a gentle war on drugs.\n\nThis bill will kill people and destroy lives without actually having any impact on rates of substances.\n\nThis bill will not house a single person.\n\nThis bill will not get a single person to treatment.\n\nThis bill will not even get a single person to diversion because there's absolutely no funding for any of that in this bill.\n\nIf council members did want to increase funding for those items, they probably would have waited to do this bill until after budget, instead of trying to push it through now and then hope everyone has forgotten about these promises when budget comes up.\n\nFor council members, council members Peterson, Nelson, Strauss and Lewis are already talking about finding efficiencies and austerity in next year's budget.\n\nThat is not going to actually increase the funding that this bill will do, which we all know it will not.\n\nAnd also drug possession is illegal.\n\nIt has been for every single day in Seattle for decades.\n\nAny overdoses you've seen, anything that makes you feel unsafe in public, that has happened while drugs are illegal.\n\nThis is nothing new.\n\nThis is continuing the same status quo that has gotten to us where we are today.\n\nWhat this bill does is it just gives our Republican city attorney, Anne Davison, full discretion on who to go and prosecute.\n\nAnd we know who her office prosecutes.\n\nShe prosecutes BIPOC community members and poor community members at massively disproportionate rates.\n\nThank you.\n\nReturning to in -person public speakers, we've got Suzanne Kotz followed by Bradley Doche.\n\nMy name is Suzanne Kotz.\n\nI'm a longtime resident of Capitol Hill and my comments are in support of this public safety ordinance.\n\nI and many other people are deeply concerned about public safety in the city.\n\nPeople need to feel safe riding on transit without worrying about the air being tainted by harmful or not harmful amounts of drugs.\n\nPeople need to feel safe patronizing restaurants in Little Saigon, which no longer can operate because people are afraid to go to that neighborhood now.\n\nPeople need to be able to shop on 3rd Avenue and enter a store.\n\nBusinesses need to know that their customers can come into their stores without having to negotiate an open -air drug market.\n\nThere has to be some point of compromise between what residents and visitors to the center need and expect and what people who are in need, who are on the streets, obviously in great distress.\n\nSo I urge you not only to pass this, but to make sure that there is funding allocated at a meeting level for diversion and support.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Bradley Dosh and Bradley will be followed by Megan O 'Hara.\n\nHi, Seattle City Council members.\n\nMy name is Bradley Dosh.\n\nI'm a constituent of Seattle Council District 1.\n\nI'm urging you to again reject the proposed legislation that would expand the city's criminal code to prosecute drug possession.\n\nAt Ruth's Young Adult Shelter, I spoke with many young people struggling with drugs.\n\nThese people need care, support, and community, not more interactions with the police.\n\nThese folks are human beings just like you and me and deserve to be treated as such.\n\nInstead of focusing on band -aid solutions, we should attack the roots of these issues.\n\nAs others have already stated, these include, but are not limited to, housing and food security, healthcare, and education.\n\nThere is a multitude of evidence that incarceration does not prevent overdoses nor give people the help they need.\n\nIt makes me angry that the city is considering a law that would increase overdoses, deaths, and racial disparities in arrests, jail time, and overdoses.\n\nThis proposed bill will bring us back to racist war on drug policies.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Megan O 'Hara and Megan will be followed by Christina McCormick.\n\nMegan.\n\nHi, my name is Megan and I'm with the Solidarity Budget.\n\nGrowing up, I had an aunt, Lori, and I spent a lot of time with her because she and my mom used to run a local business together.\n\nUnfortunately, she became addicted to opioids after a surgery and eventually fentanyl became a primary drug.\n\nAnd I'll never forget the day that I was on the phone with my mom and she found her dead from an overdose.\n\nAnd I'm sharing this with you all because I want to ask the council, have you ever shared a home with somebody who's addicted to opioids, particularly fentanyl, or had a truly close relationship with somebody addicted to opioids?\n\nBecause the most painful part isn't just losing somebody, but it's watching the battle of trying to get clean.\n\nAnd I've learned so much since her death about what could have worked and professionals here will share with you evidence -based solutions and that's not my role.\n\nBut one thing that they know definitively does not work\n\nAnd one thing every family member of somebody addicted to fentanyl knows doesn't work is incarceration.\n\nAnd if you don't know up close the struggle of trying to get clean, you can't pass this legislation because you don't know what you're up against.\n\nThis legislation sentences someone else's family member to death.\n\nAnd it's too late for my aunt, but it isn't too late for somebody else's family.\n\nSo vote no, because we can't waste any resources on making this problem worse.\n\nThank you.\n\nNext speaker is Christina Mann followed by Aretha Basu.\n\nHello, I'm Chris from the South side of Seattle.\n\nI'm in three separate organizations that work directly with individuals, dealing with substance issues.\n\nAnd to be honest, I joined three different organizations.\n\nI know it sounds like a lot because I believe in the community coming together to create solutions that are backed by data.\n\nI believe in seeing the young people that are with me in these organizations come together and look at data to go about this different community policies and there are plenty of angry, angry young people here today because we're sick of our public officials not listening to data when they create policies.\n\nWe're sick of having to come to things like this to tell you directly, hey, this isn't gonna work because you don't have data to back it up.\n\nAnd so here we are again, doing this again, months later again, because you're still not listening to data to back up policies.\n\nYoung people are sick of it and we're here to take our future.\n\nWe're here organizing.\n\nWe're here to talk to you.\n\nWe're here to take your jobs.\n\nWe're running for office.\n\nWe're here.\n\nOur next speaker is Aretha Basu followed by Dominic Driscoll.\n\nGood morning, council members.\n\nAretha Basu, political director of Puget Sound SAGE and SAGE Leaders.\n\nOn behalf of my organization, I ask you to vote no on the bill before you today.\n\nThis bill creates another inroad to incarceration because involvement in the criminal legal system does not heal people, does not house people, nor does it address the root causes of substance use.\n\nI appreciate council members' efforts to place guardrails within the bill towards diversion and detailed language on SPD conduct.\n\nHowever, people's access to treatment and resources should not have to come through contact with police and the system in the first place.\n\nWhat scares me most about this bill is that it places an enormous amount of authority and discretion in the hands of SPD, a department we just spent the last three years saying that very discretion didn't belong in.\n\nI have the gray hairs to prove it.\n\nI'm not even 30.\n\nThis fear is exacerbated by the story just this morning where Officer Daniel Arter said that the life of Jehannavi Kandula, who was killed by SPD, had limited value and that the city should cut a check.\n\nIs this who we trust to divert people and connect them with resources instead of arrest them on day -to -day interactions?\n\nNo.\n\nVote no today.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Dominic Driscoll, and Dominic will be followed by Christopher Arellano.\n\nHello.\n\nFirst off, I would like to thank the housing developers for showing up today, the folks who created the housing crisis and thus are a major contributor to the public health crisis in Seattle that is drug use or overdoses in particular.\n\nI'm here today in particular to remind y 'all that this bill is going to backfire because when the stuff is banned in public, people do it in private and they are going to see a spike in overdoses that are untreated.\n\nWhen that happens, that increases the fatality rate in Seattle, and by the time that happens, it's going to be the time for the next election, and the people who are going to be blamed are the city council.\n\nI would advise you, if you want to keep your seat, to vote against this bill.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Christopher Arellano followed by Colin Scone.\n\nMy name is Chris Arellano.\n\nI'm a representative to UFCW members in Seattle and King County and a constituent of D6.\n\nCouncil members, we've been here before, not just in this room and on this bill, but in this war on drugs.\n\nSince the sixties, our government has taken a punitive approach towards drug use and addiction.\n\nIf punishing people for drug use works, why are we here 60 years later?\n\nPunishing people for addiction doesn't work, period.\n\nIf you want to see less suffering in our streets, you all should focus your time on the root causes of homelessness and addiction.\n\nDo something about the soaring price of housing and runaway inflation.\n\nThat would be a great place to start, and it would positively affect the constituents you deem clean or worthy as well.\n\nLouis, Strauss, if you're listening, do what we at UFCW 3000 endorsed you to do, which is the right thing for our members, for your constituents, for the people of Seattle.\n\nVote no.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Colin Scone, and Colin will be followed by Lisa Marcus.\n\nColin Scone.\n\nOkay, moving on to Lisa Marcus.\n\nWe have Lisa Marcus in the room.\n\nOkay, and then followed by, Lisa Marcus followed by Stephanie Tidholm.\n\nHi, I'm Lisa Marcus.\n\nI'm a constituent.\n\nI live in Green Lake for the last 25 years.\n\nI actually have a close family friend who died of a fentanyl overdose.\n\nIn his bed, in a Green Lake home.\n\nThis is not a problem of just some people.\n\nThis is a problem that needs addressing at a mental health level, at a societal support level.\n\nPeople need to have the resources to go and get help.\n\nIf it's stigmatized, if it's criminalized, people will die.\n\nThis is not a solution.\n\nAny money going toward solution needs to go toward the organizations which provide the support to housing, which gets people what they basic needs, not to criminalizing, not to the police.\n\nPlease, please vote no on this bill.\n\nOur next speaker is Stephanie Tidholm and Stephanie will be followed by Luca Howard.\n\nHello, my name is Stephanie Tidholm.\n\nI'm a longtime resident of District 1 as well as a case manager on the LEAD program.\n\nI wanna say that I do appreciate the efforts of the mayor and a few of our council members in enhancing some of the diversion services.\n\nBut I will say working previously as a substance abuse counselor, that the Housing First model is paramount.\n\nI know that the language is criminalizing drug use, but ultimately we're criminalizing homelessness and not having the allocation of resources to be able to house these people and sustainable housing at that and affordable housing is a huge issue.\n\nAnd if we don't do something to enhance the funding, not only for the LEAD and the REACH program, but all social services programs that are serving this population, we're going to continue these same cycles of people being on the streets.\n\nSo I would urge you to consider where these resources are being allocated and allocate the funds accordingly so that we can actually resolve this issue and not keep going in this crazy circle.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Luca Howard and Luca Howard will be followed by Renaissance.\n\nHello, I'm Luca Howard, a D5 resident and I'm here speaking against the drug war that everybody here is pursuing.\n\nI'm going to read you an excerpt.\n\nI think she went up on the hood, hit the windshield and then when he hit the brakes, she flew off the car, but she's dead.\n\nIt's a regular person.\n\nJust write a check for $11 ,000.\n\nShe was 26 anyway.\n\nShe had limited value.\n\nThis was the police reaction to them killing somebody.\n\nDo you really expect this police force to fairly and equitably enforce the legislation you propose, especially considering that nobody here has created enough police alternatives to actually support the bill in the way that you want them to?\n\nPlease vote no on this bill.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Renaissance.\n\nAnd this is, Renaissance is our last speaker signed up for public comment in person.\n\nMy name is Renaissance.\n\nI'm the co -director of campaigns at 350 Seattle.\n\nI'm also an organizer with Seattle Solidarity Budget and an organizer with Whose Streets? Our Streets.\n\nAnd today I brought a book because oftentimes it seems like we are blowing smoke at the council.\n\nAnd this book is called No More Police.\n\nIt was authored by Mariam Kaba and Andre Ritchie.\n\nAnd everything that has been discussed today about why to oppose this bill and this piece of legislation is contained in this book and many others.\n\nAnd something that I've heard over and over today in this council, inflammatory language around open air markets and a great author, Michelle Alexander, who authored The New Jim Crow, talked about the comparison between open air markets and closed house markets.\n\nAnd what we're actually discussing is the difference between who was selling and doing the drugs as opposed to just where the drugs are being sold at.\n\nAnd then over and over, we've heard about Daniel Honduras, the SPD officer who was talking about John V. Candula.\n\nAnd when he said her life had little value, he was talking about young BIPOC migrant folks and those are not the kinds of people that we can trust to enforce these kinds of laws.\n\nSo vote no on this legislation.\n\nThank you.\n\nThere's one more person who's signed up online and that is Reed Olson.\n\nReed, if you're with us, we can hear from you now.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nAlso, one more person.\n\nHello, can you hear me?\n\nGo ahead, Reed.\n\nThank you.\n\nWhere do I begin?\n\nYeah, this is my third time calling in to say no against this racist, classist, stupid, dangerous war on drugs, which is really just a way to brutalize homeless people.\n\nThis is about some people are uncomfortable seeing unhoused humans in the streets where they do business.\n\nAnd I'm upset about that too, but for different reasons.\n\nWe need a housing first model.\n\nWe needed it yesterday.\n\nPeople like Tobias from Real Change have done great reporting on how verbiage like open air drug markets allow for sensationalization, pro -clutching, and allows a certain set of people to wash their hands and consider our unhoused neighbors as humans.\n\nThis is not something that was written by caregivers.\n\nI work in healthcare.\n\nI work with many of the people you are trying to criminalize.\n\nI think it's dangerous.\n\nPlease find it in your hearts to vote no.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd we have a couple of folks still signing up for in -person public comment.\n\nSo we'll return to that.\n\nWe've got Aiden Carroll followed by Shannon Newsome.\n\nSo this bill is as wrong as it was in the spring.\n\nI appreciate, I guess, some of the attempts to increase diversion, but unless there's treatment to go to, it doesn't really mean anything.\n\nAnd as long as there is drugs being confiscated or people being arrested, that's going to increase overdoses.\n\nThe myth of refusing help is typically intertwined in these things.\n\nAnd the fact is that people want treatment, but the treatment system we have needs to be fixed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of insurance, in terms of Suboxone, in terms of the length of time before and after.\n\nAnd the outpatient treatment is real treatment and it's the kind that works best for people who are not going to be housed anytime soon.\n\nPlease keep all of that in mind and do not vote for something that is going to kill people.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Shannon Newsome.\n\nThank you.\n\nHi, I'm Shannon Newsome.\n\nI am a constituent in Capitol Hill.\n\nI have grown up in the Seattle area in Bellevue and now in Seattle.\n\nI am a...\n\nProfessionally, I'm trained in social work.\n\nAnd personally, I'm a member of the peer recovery community.\n\nI know that in the 1700s, King George, at the time of the American Revolution, had a mental illness.\n\nAnd he got the most, the best treatments around, which were for his stuff, bipolar disorder, exposure to nature, time with a therapist, a consultation.\n\nAnd another person during this time was locked up for her mental illness and did not receive treatment.\n\nThe King George recovered from his pressing crisis.\n\nThe person that was locked up was not, she was in, she was criminalized for the rest of her life.\n\nAnd the recovery community, we have the knowledge that criminalization just doesn't work.\n\nThank you.\n\nCanon is our last in -person public speaker.\n\nReturning to the online speakers, none of the folks who were showing as not present are showing present.\n\nSo with that, we will conclude public comment and we will move into the single item on our agenda.\n\nWill the clerk please read in agenda item one.\n\nAgenda item one, council bill 120645.\n\nAn ordinance relating to controlled substances, adding the crimes of knowing possession of a controlled substance and use of a controlled substance in a public place.\n\nAmending section 128 .09 .020 of the Seattle Municipal Code and adding a new section 3 .28 .141 to the Seattle Municipal Code.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nI have some introductory remarks and my co -sponsor on this bill may have some as well.\n\nAnd then we'll work on hearing from central staff and getting the substitute in front of us and hearing some of the amendments.\n\nSo just as background, this committee hosted a briefing from the mayor's office on this bill back on August 14th.\n\nI wanna say publicly that I appreciate that the executive has taken a nuanced approach in its proposal to implement the authority granted by the state legislature, consistent with the role of the mayor as head of the executive branch of government.\n\nI appreciate the delineation within the bill of how the authority is intended to be used in practice when deciding whether to pursue a diversion or arrest and providing clear practical direction to officers on how to use the authority.\n\nI further appreciate the findings in the bill itself and the recitals stating for instance, that diversion is the preferred approach in the city of Seattle.\n\nUnlike the previous version of the bill, when we say diversion is the preferred approach in the city of Seattle, this includes what is called pre -arrest diversion that it will be used for many that this bill directs officers to use their discretion to not choose to arrest because they are not meeting the definition in the bill of committing harm to others.\n\nThen there's another kind of diversion that we refer to as pre -booking diversion that will be used and prioritized for others.\n\nThis is language that was neither in the state law nor was in the previous version of the bill.\n\nAnd it really, I think does a good job of implementing the mayor's approach of a desire to balance public safety objectives with the mayor's own experience with the war on drugs.\n\nWe know that a law enforcement only approach won't work, not only because of the limited number of officers and the limitations on jail capacity, but because enforcement only is not an approach that works for everyone.\n\nAnd we really need to work to get the resources that we have available for pre -arrest diversion and pre -booking diversion to assist people in living more productive and healthy lives.\n\nThe recitals also recognize that prior federal, state and local drug enforcement and policies, including the war on drugs has disproportionately impacted black, indigenous and people of color.\n\nAnd that causes trauma and pain that still linger in these communities today.\n\nAnd the bill states that the city of Seattle is committed to not repeating the errors of the past and will work to have the implementation, will have the implementation of this ordinance to balance public safety with the wellbeing of individuals using controlled substance.\n\nClearly stating that commitment to a balanced approach is vitally important.\n\nAgain, state law applies everywhere throughout the state.\n\nSo the state law making possession in public use gross to misdemeanors applies in Seattle, whether or not we act on this bill or not.\n\nThis bill, I believe does meet in the middle as we heard from some public testimony.\n\nI wanna give a little bit of a background on, excuse me, we cannot have any disruptions while the council is debating the bill.\n\nThe time for public comment is over.\n\nIn a August 14th committee meeting of this committee with a panel discussion with providers, such as LEAD, REACH, We Deliver Care on 3rd Avenue, the Public Defender Association and the Fire Department.\n\nWe heard from frontline workers to identify the gaps in diversion services.\n\nThis briefing made very clear to everyone on this committee that we have much work to do.\n\nKey points that were made were the importance of stability for people trying to access addiction and related issues, things like sleep, food and safety.\n\nThis ties into the lack of availability of housing and barriers to access housing and long -term care.\n\nWe Deliver Care, for example, reported that they can regularly get people into detox, but often there's nowhere for persons coming out of detox to go afterwards.\n\nAnother presenter in that committee meeting shared a story of a client who the court determined needed substance use treatment.\n\nThis person had high medical needs.\n\nTheir health was so compromised that there was no treatment facility in the entire state that would admit this individual.\n\nThis client had, again, very high medical needs and needed substance use treatment, had no options to get care.\n\nAnd what happened after this client sat in jail for four months was that the city prosecutor dismissed the case.\n\nAnd this individual was released to the street with no care, again, after sitting in jail for four months.\n\nRepresentatives for the Fire Department's Health One Division spoke to the difficult cycle of withdrawal from Frentenel and the importance of stability coming out of the mayor's April executive order.\n\nHealth One established a new specialized unit to respond to overdose calls.\n\nWe learned that between January and July 31st, 2023, first responders and bystanders have, on average, responded to 11 overdoses a day in a public place.\n\nAgain, that's 11 individuals who had their overdoses reversed, either successfully or not, each and every day between January and July 31st.\n\nAfter a successful overdose of a person living unsheltered, Health One saves a life and then has no other option but to leave the person whose life they've just saved exactly where they found them.\n\nThe panel spoke to the need for a post -overdose diversion facility where these frontline workers, these first responders, can bring people after a non -fatal overdose to recover, get stabilized on medications and access resources.\n\nIn my next committee meeting coming up in September, I believe it's the 26th, we will discuss the mayor's funding for this post -overdose recovery facility.\n\nI do appreciate working with co -sponsor Lewis and the mayor's office on both the underlying bill and the substitute that we'll be discussing today, but I'll hold comments on the substitute until we get to it and we'll turn it over to Council Member Lewis as co -sponsor to make introductory remarks.\n\nThank you so much, Chair Herbold.\n\nI'll be brief, given your comprehensive overview of the legislation.\n\nI do wanna thank at the front, Andrew Meyerberg, who's sitting in the gallery, who has really shepherded this policy process over the last several months, working closely with Mayor Harrell, and thank Mayor Harrell for his very direct and hands -on attention to this policy to really make sure that this issue, which I think everybody can agree is one of the biggest and most pressing issues in the city, is getting the attention that it deserves, is getting the focus that it deserves in how to have a practical on -the -ground policy to implement it, and that what we are really focusing on here is how to take full advantage of our provider community, the resources that they bring to the forefront to facilitate warm handoffs from law enforcement to providers, in many cases, as was mentioned in the public comment, to have providers just do the initial outreach without the involvement of law enforcement.\n\nThat is still compatible with the enforcement of this legislation.\n\nAnd to keep these public health crises to the greatest extent possible outside of the slow and ponderous criminal legal system where cases can drag on for months, for months, for years, where things can be dismissed without a person ever getting access to any kind of help or assistance, and to have a policy put in place that triages, prioritizes, and takes full advantage of a ecosystem that we have developed to an extent that is an international best practice, where law enforcement -assisted diversion will go around the world to give seminars on the work that we have done around harm -reduction -informed care to take full advantage of those systems to make sure that wellness and best practices in public health are the things that are highlighted in our approach, while also reserving the ability and the leeway and the discretion to hold people accountable in situations where that help and assistance is not always taken advantage of.\n\nThis legislation strikes that balance.\n\nIt'll be followed on by executive actions that complement it that we have been working on through Mayor Harrell's task force.\n\nIt'll be followed on by budget additions that have been foreshadowed and that will be part of our budget discussions this fall.\n\nAnd with that, I think I'll hand it back over to you, Chair Herbold, and thank you for your leadership in really helping to marshal the council's resources to produce this legislative product and look forward to discussing amendments from colleagues and the underlying legislation.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAnd so to procedurally allow us to begin to discuss the amendments, we do need to move the underlying bill.\n\nI intend to do so and ask for a second.\n\nAnd then after that, I will do the same for the substitute, but I will also ask that Council Central staff help walk us through that substitute.\n\nSo Council Members, I move the committee recommends the passage of Council Bill 120645.\n\nIs there a second?\n\nSecond.\n\nThank you.\n\nCouncil Bill 120645 has been moved and seconded.\n\nWe can now move on to consideration of amendments.\n\nAgain, I will first ask for a motion, then after the motion and second, we'll ask Central staff to describe the amendment and ask the sponsor to add any comments they have to the amendment themselves.\n\nSo first up is Amendment 1, sponsored by myself and Council Member Lewis.\n\nThere is a revised version of this amendment that was shared this morning by email.\n\nIs there a motion?\n\nMove the substitute Amendment 1.\n\nThank you.\n\nIs there a second?\n\nI will second it.\n\nYou motioned, I will second it.\n\nSo the revised version of Substitute Amendment 1 is now before us and we can move forward with Council Central staff describing to us the changes in the substitute as compared to the introduced bill.\n\nOkay.\n\nGood morning, committee members.\n\nAsha Venkatraman of your Council Central staff.\n\nAs Council Member Herbold mentioned, there is a revised version of the substitute for your consideration.\n\nThere were just multiple technical updates that we made to this version two, but I'll go through this version two and describe each of the changes as they come up.\n\nAnd so first, as you'll see on the amendment, we added a recital.\n\nThat recital says, whereas while pre -booking diversion and community -based care are preferred, there may be unique articulable circumstances that are so acute or problematic that they make pre -booking diversion alternatives an ineffective response to the situation.\n\nThe second is a reference to the crimes covered in the state bill.\n\nIt adds a new subsection 3 .28141A.\n\nIt's mostly a technical change.\n\nIt's just so the short or abbreviated versions of what crimes are covered by this ordinance.\n\nSo things shorthand like possession of drugs or public use of a controlled substance, it creates just one reference to the crimes covered so that we can repeat that reference throughout the section.\n\nThe next would add a new subsection E3 to 3 .28141.\n\nAnd it makes clear that if diversion rather than arrest is the appropriate response to an individual, the lack of availability of diversion should not mean that an arrest should occur instead.\n\nSo the added language in there is a lack of diversion opportunities shall not be a reason for arrest.\n\nThe next change refers to the same policy in 3 .28141E that pre -booking diversion is preferred even when a person poses a threat of harm to others.\n\nThat addition goes in the threat of harm to others section.\n\nAnd it's intended to make clear that diversion is the preferred response regardless of the outcome of a threat of harm assessment.\n\nThe next item changes references to the threat of harm to others and threat of harm to self sections, just to be consistent in saying that a threat of harm assessment is not an element of the crime to be proved during prosecution.\n\nThe next item clarifies that in the threat of harm to self section, that if an individual is not determined to be a threat of harm to others, then they only pose a threat of harm to themselves.\n\nThe next change clarifies that officers are exempt from complying with the requirement that they make a reasonable attempt to contact and coordinate efforts towards diversion, outreach or other alternatives to arrest if the most appropriate or viable care strategy appears to be transport to a diversion point of contact, a medical care facility, a crisis care center or a diversion facility.\n\nThe next change specifies that officers may not arrest a person when they are only a harm to themselves without additional, excuse me, additional articulable facts and circumstances that would warrant arrest and details that SBD policies should identify what those additional facts and circumstances are.\n\nThe next change adds a new subsection that would ask SPD to try and use officers with 40 or more hours of crisis intervention team training to respond to these crimes where operationally possible.\n\nAnd then the next change adds a new section four and that section establishes a behavioral health advisory committee intended to advise the city about the needs for change in police protocols in this legislation or any other policies related to this legislation as well as an ask to provide data that is recommended for collection by the state substance use and recovery services plan biannually.\n\nNow, those are all the changes that were included in version one of this amendment.\n\nAs you'll have seen, as we've been scrolling throughout, there are highlighted changes and those are the changes that make up this version two.\n\nSo starting at the bottom here, you'll see there's an additional section five that lays out the authority for the city to create this legislation and lays out some express purposes for the legislation itself as well as some pieces about specific intent.\n\nMoving backwards from there, you will see highlighted this new section J and it makes clear that an officer's failure to comply with the sections around threat of harm or anything else in this legislation is not intended to be a basis to exclude or render evidence inadmissible.\n\nGoing back up from there, you'll see highlighted in subsection two there, a clarification of what reasonableness is when talking about the officer's discretion and just making clear that reasonableness is determined from the perspective of a reasonable officer facing similar circumstances.\n\nBut then going up from there, just a clarity added to subsection G, which is the threat of harm to others assessment, that the assessment itself will occur after probable cause has been established.\n\nSo just making sure that the timeline on that is clear.\n\nThis last piece is just including that nothing in the ordinance mandates that an arrest should occur.\n\nSo we're not taking away any of the officer's discretion to arrest if they choose to do so.\n\nThere's no requirements for arrest that are described in the legislation.\n\nI think that is all of the additional changes made to this version of the amendment.\n\nThank you so much, Asha.\n\nI just wanna also take a moment to thank Council Member Mosqueda and her staff for their work on this substitute.\n\nMuch of what we heard that Asha go through on the substitute were clarifying sections in a way that is consistent with the Mayor's proposal, the introduced version of the Mayor's proposal.\n\nBut there are some substantive additions.\n\nAnd I thank Council Member Mosqueda for some of those substantive additions, including the efforts to prioritize officers with 40 or more hours of crisis intervention team training, as well as the creation of the Behavioral Health Committee to advise the city on needs for changes in police protocol legislation or this particular policy after having an opportunity to see how the police policies and procedures are working on the ground and making sure that we have folks who have expertise in addressing the needs of individuals and have them in the driver's seat in making recommendations to policy.\n\nSo with that, do we have questions or comments about the substitute?\n\nJust looking both virtually for a virtual Council Member, as well as in person, not seeing any.\n\nYeah, up.\n\nOh, sorry, I do have a few comments.\n\nOh, there you are.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm not seeing your hand here.\n\nThat's okay.\n\nI'm gonna put a different screen up.\n\nAll right, there you go.\n\nGo for it.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nYou might've blended in with my background there.\n\nThank you, Madam Chair.\n\nAnd thank you for your comments as well about the work that our team has done.\n\nLed by Melanie Cray and the incredible work that she has done literally round the clock throughout the recess.\n\nUnfortunately, she spent many of her days and nights trying to do additional research on the legislation in front of us.\n\nSo I do appreciate the note of appreciation for her.\n\nMelanie Cray on our team and in partnership with Asha Vankantraman and Greg Goss and Lauren Henry and Ann Gorman and Jen Lebrek, all from central staff who similarly spent tireless hours over the break working on this.\n\nI just have a few comments on the substitute bill, Madam Chair, and much of the substitute bill, as you've noted, has been informed by conversation with the community.\n\nSo I'll just say thanks to those folks right now since the substitute will form the basis for the legislation that we'll consider here in a minute.\n\nSo thanks again to folks from LEAD and PDA, Lisa Dugard and Tara Moss for consulting with us along with Anita Condewall, Director of King County Department of Public Defense for her partnership and advocacy in reaching out and the folks at REACH, SEIU 925, DESC, King County Department of Community and Harm Services.\n\nAnd of course, the folks at the ACLU Washington for their help in thinking through some of the complex issues that we are trying to address in our city here and to build on the state legislation.\n\nCouncil Member Herbold, as chair of the committee, you have just been a incredibly accessible leader on this issue along with your staff member, Newell Aldridge.\n\nSo I wanna thank you and your team for your engagement with my team specifically, ongoing conversations with Melanie over the break on this bill.\n\nI do wanna express my support for the substitute bill.\n\nI really do appreciate the panel that you led with, Madam Chair, in our previous committee meeting.\n\nI believe that the substitute bill really leaned in heavily, as you noted, on trying to make sure that there is a array of community partners out there that want to have more services and want to have more resources to assist people and this legislation, I think, with the substitute makes it clear that arrests and charging should be an extreme last resort and not the first resort.\n\nOnly when a person cannot be deescalated by a lead to prevent booking and go into charging, I think that this makes a lot of good strides in making that clear.\n\nI'm glad to support this because I think that it makes clear that pre -booking diversion is a priority for people as we try to also reduce the harm to themselves or to others and pre -arrest diversion is a priority for people who pose a threat of harm only to themselves.\n\nSo I think that there's good clarification in here and it creates really solid data collection requirements.\n\nI will note my concerns with the underlying bill that are still embedded in the substitute, even though I am going to be supporting the substitute vote here at this point in the committee, it still involves police in what is a public health crisis, despite the decades of data that show us that police and arrests only exacerbate harm when we are trying to force them to serve in this role and force people into a system when they really need public health services.\n\nIt still allows for people to become entangled in the criminal legal system and it still perpetuates a system of beliefs that was debunked decades ago.\n\nI'm specifically concerned with the addition that we saw from yesterday's version that says, quote, an officer's failure to comply with subsections 328 .141G and 328 .141H or any other provisions of this legislation will not be a basis to exclude or render inadmissible any subsequently obtained evidence.\n\nMy concern is that this removes an important component of the substitute that we had previously seen.\n\nI think that it significantly disadvantages people who face criminal charges under the law.\n\nI am worried that it limits defendants potential defense if police don't follow the guardrails that we set out clearly in this legislation and they will end up in jail.\n\nAnd as we've seen from reports and headlines and public health data, sending people to jail only exacerbates the chances that they will have an overdose or they will die either in jail or when they come out of jail and begin consuming again.\n\nSo my concern is that the framework on this still allows for a system that is not backed by public health data and the guardrail language is good that we worked on.\n\nI think it makes it much clearer that diversion should always be the first approach.\n\nAnd I do hope that this is a signal of our support for arrest being the absolute last resort before booking and going to jail.\n\nSo I'll be a yes on this up today.\n\nAnd I thank the chair for including many of the amendment and policy ideas that our team and community had been suggesting.\n\nThank you, Madam Chair.\n\nYep.\n\nMuch appreciated.\n\nAny other?\n\nYes, Council Member Peterson.\n\nChair Herbold, can you talk more about the Behavioral Health Alternatives Committee?\n\nAnd is that something that would need to be permanent or is it something that we're after time it'll be clear what direction we're heading and it doesn't need to be in perpetuity and advisory committee?\n\nYeah, I think the thinking that I have expressed to the executive on this item is given that there is a fentanyl users task force that is made up of many of the same individuals that we would want to be monitoring the use of this ordinance, that it would make sense for the responsibility here to sort of morph into the work of the fentanyl users task force.\n\nThat's what's been discussed with the executive.\n\nWe've intentionally kept it loose because I think this is a piece that we still need to work out.\n\nThere was some consideration of much more formalized language about whether or not the council should appoint some members and the mayor should appoint whether or not we would be following our normal procedures for formal commissions.\n\nAnd I didn't think it was a good idea to go that route because there's still more to be discussed with the executive about the formation of that group.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nI'll look forward to that discussion.\n\nYeah.\n\nThanks.\n\nAny other comments on the substitute?\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nThank you.\n\nSo it took two years and a special session for the state legislature to come up with a Blake fix.\n\nAnd now we have a law, but the city of Seattle is about to break it by imposing several conditions that will restrict officer's ability to make arrests, even though they have probable cause.\n\nAnd that's tragic in itself because the drug crisis is the most crushing public safety, public health issue of our time right now.\n\nAnd let me replay, excuse me.\n\nWe need to hear from the council members on the dais.\n\nI cannot have disruptions to our process, our democratic process.\n\nPlease keep your comments contained and allow the council members to speak as I've recognized them.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThat's, let me repeat that past paragraph.\n\nThat's tragic in itself because the drug crisis we see playing out on our streets is the most crushing public health and safety issue of our time with Washington having the highest number of overdoses in the US and the vast majority occurring in Seattle.\n\nAnd restricting arrests means people will not be diverted into treatment, which is the goal.\n\nIt's the goal that we've been stating all along here and is still my fundamental goal.\n\nAnd I'm also very concerned about the legal risks presented by these proposed modifications to state law.\n\nOn in the August 14th special meeting, I expressed concern that requiring officers to assess a threat of harm to others, however that's defined, and we haven't seen the EO yet, the executive order, inserts officer discretion directly into the law and could open the city up to allegations of bias policing and or be used in a motion to dismiss by the defense.\n\nAnd since that meeting, none of the information that I've received, which has been extensive, has allayed those concerns.\n\nAnd this substitute, despite the changes that have been made that I've seen only this morning, only increases my concerns about legal risk because it adds a whole bunch of more conditions and complexity.\n\nAnd so that is why I put forward two amendments.\n\nHopefully we'll be able to talk about those after all the other amendments.\n\nBut I'm getting the sense that this is, that if we, that this is the passage of this substitute is sort of the deal breaker for the sponsors to vote on the whole bill.\n\nIs that the case?\n\nThis is the bill that Council Member Lewis and I are sponsoring.\n\nSo this is, and the substitute that is before us largely clarifies the intent that was in the underlying bill.\n\nAs I mentioned, there are only two substantive differences and that relates to the officers that are used for enforcing the law, having preferencing, prioritizing that they have CRT training and the committee.\n\nEverything else that you see before you in this substitute is a clarification of the original introduced bill proposed by the mayor and sponsored by Council Member Lewis and I.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis.\n\nYes, the thing that I would just clarify is I don't think the phrasing of whether this substitute is contingent for my vote is the proper phrasing.\n\nI would rather say the substitute is the result of a long and comprehensive collaborative process with Mayor Harrell and expresses Mayor Harrell's clear preferences in how to take this law into practice in the city of Seattle.\n\nSo I don't think the characterization comports with the collaboration that the council has had with the mayor's office over the last several weeks in putting this together.\n\nThis substitute is supported by the mayor's office and was extensively crafted in consultation with them.\n\nSo I just want to make that clear on the record.\n\nAnd again, thank Mayor Harrell for his leadership in promulgating these policies for our consideration.\n\nThank you.\n\nAny other comments or questions?\n\nI just don't, my question is should, are the additional amendments on here, are they amendments or additions to your, the language that you put forward in the substitute?\n\nI just don't know when to suggest that we consider the amendments that I distributed this morning.\n\nThe parliamentary procedure is after we vote on the substitute, then we will go through the amendments to the substitute.\n\nOkay, thank you very much.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSeeing no further questions or comments, Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll on the adoption of amendment one?\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nNay.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nYes.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nYes.\n\nFour yes, one no.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nThe motion carries and the amendment is adopted.\n\nWe can now move on to the next amendment.\n\nNext up is amendment number two, sponsored by Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nAgain, let's get it in front of us with a motion and a second, and then we'll talk about it.\n\nIs there a motion?\n\nThank you very much, Madam Chair.\n\nI move that the committee consider amendment number two.\n\nThank you so much, I second the motion.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt's been moved and seconded to adopt amendment two.\n\nCould Council Central staff please describe the amendment?\n\nThank you, Madam Chair.\n\nGreg Doss, Council Central staff.\n\nAs you're aware, in the substitute, section G talks about a threat of harms to others and has officers, when considering making an arrest of an individual, determining a threat of harm to others through their actions, conduct, as to whether or not that individual presents a threat.\n\nWhat this amendment before you would do is to ask that when defined in SPD policies, the threat of harm standard shall be comprised of factors that are related to a potential that physical harm will be inflicted upon a person by another as evidenced by behavior which has caused such harm or which places another person or persons in reasonable fear of sustaining such harm.\n\nAdditionally, such factors may not include the mere use of drugs in public absent additional factors.\n\nThank you, Greg.\n\nCan you also just touch upon how state law relates and where it doesn't?\n\nYeah, thank you.\n\nSo there is a, there is under state law, officers are able to determine when individuals are presenting a likelihood of serious harm and they are able to take into custody an individual to receive a behavioral health evaluation under the Involuntary Treatment Act.\n\nAnd there is specific language in the RCW and it's reflected in SPD policy that determines when individuals are displaying behavior that would allow officers to do that.\n\nThis language mirrors that language in the sense that these characteristics and these behaviors would be identifiable by the individual who would be using or possessing drugs in public.\n\nThe difference would be that this person would not be rising to the level of needing custody or a behavioral health evaluation.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAre there comments from the sponsor?\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nThank you again, Madam Chair.\n\nThanks for seconding this amendment here.\n\nThis amendment, as central staff noted, is really about attempting to safeguard against implicit racial bias.\n\nThis is an attempt here to ensure that there is a true threat of harm and that where we have a defined way to assess that threat of harm that doesn't default to an individual's bias.\n\nWe know that people of color are much more likely to be seen as a threat for the same behavior as their white counterpart.\n\nThis amendment also tries to ensure that people are not becoming involved with the criminal legal system unless they are putting another person's physical safety in danger and that the person cannot be deescalated.\n\nIf that person cannot be deescalated with interventions by LEAD and LEAD being the primary approach and only in the very extreme and very rare cases that people are being booked into jail and offered another off -ramp to LEAD and pretrial diversion.\n\nSo the attempt here is to ensure that physical safety and the physical danger of someone else is clearly defined and that we've used deescalation and intervention strategies first before going to arrest and booking into jail.\n\nAnd finally, this amendment attempts to protect against unnecessary interactions with the legal systems as well as safeguard against misinformation serving as the bias for arrest under this statute.\n\nAnd I wanna underscore the importance of safeguarding against misinformation as serving for the bias of arrest under the statute.\n\nFor example, we all know that it is extremely frustrating and unhealthy for us to have the sense of breathing in secondhand smoke.\n\nBut many people, including today, have commented on secondhand smoke and fentanyl smoke being an example of where they felt their own physical health was in danger.\n\nI wanna point to the fact that our King County Public Health Department has had a recent question and answer session with the director of the Washington Poison Control Center to dispel this myth.\n\nSo this amendment tries to help identify where there's misinformation that could be leading to someone's arrest because a person may feel that their physical health or safety is in danger when in fact secondhand fentanyl smoke, according to the King County Public Health Department, continues to show that bystanders who breathe in secondhand smoke are not physically at risk.\n\nStudies, and I wanna quote from Public Health Insider and from the King County Public Health Department.\n\nQuote, studies have looked at fentanyl concentrations in the bloodstream after someone has had secondhand fentanyl exposure from smoke.\n\nThere is no risk for the everyday person being exposed to secondhand opioid smoke.\n\nWhen someone smokes fentanyl, most of the drug has already been filtered out by the user before there is secondhand smoke.\n\nAnd that comes and it's published from public health on publichealthinsider .com.\n\nThis is from April 5th of 2022, if you wanna look it up under, is it safe question and answer session about secondhand fentanyl smoke.\n\nSo yes, it is important for us to have a clear definition of physical harm so that people aren't making assumptions about what physical harm is and that individuals who are involved in arrests are not defaulting to any bias where they might perceive someone as being a threat when we don't have a clear way of defining threat to a person's physical harm.\n\nI wanna avoid compounding any bias.\n\nAnd again, I wanna lean on public health data.\n\nSo that's the intent of this amendment here, Madam Chair.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAppreciate your explaining your policy basis as well as your advocacy for the clarity of this amendment.\n\nI will have some comments on it before we vote, but I'm gonna defer to Council Member Nelson.\n\nSo your hand is up.\n\nNo, that was, oh, it's an old hand over, sorry.\n\nOkay, so any other comments on this, Council Member Peterson?\n\nThank you, Chair Herbold, and thank you, Council Member Mosqueda for explaining this amendment.\n\nThe big picture for me here is that the state government had a compromise that they crafted carefully, and I would prefer to implement that as is into our Seattle Municipal Code because it was already a compromise on public health and safety.\n\nI think the mayor's additional provisions of harm to self, harm to others add complicating factors for implementation.\n\nI think that if we layer onto that, this amendment, it increases that complexity and potentially a legal risk for the city, and so I'll be voting no on this.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you, Council Member Peterson.\n\nAre there other comments?\n\nWhile my colleagues are considering whether or not they have comments, I'm just gonna speak to why I'm a little torn about this amendment.\n\nI really appreciate how we've been working hand -in -hand with the executive in good faith to create this sort of dual track that is different than what state law proposed.\n\nIt is not in conflict, but it is different because it assumes that a cohort of people who are not harming any others will not be arrested and will be helped with pre -arrest diversion.\n\nI think, for me, the complexity is in the harm to self and harm to others definitions, which will be in future policies developed by the police department.\n\nAnd historically, we've had some challenges with administrative policies that have been sort of overused or improperly used.\n\nI think most recently, we can point to what we refer to colloquially as the MDARs, which allow for encampment removals without advanced notice when they are considered to be obstructions, and the ACLU has sued the city and the court has agreed with their findings that the city is defining too many things as obstructions.\n\nAnd I could see something similar to that happening in this case, that the police policies may define too many things as harm to others, not just harm to self.\n\nSo I really appreciate the sentiment of this amendment, but I also simultaneously am concerned that it may be too narrow.\n\nAnd so I think what I'm inclined to do as it relates to this amendment is to abstain and between now and the full council vote on the legislation have some additional conversations with the executive to get some further understanding and reassurances that the definitions that are yet to be created in the police department policies defining threat of harm to others are not so all encompassing that they basically include everything and really make the intent of this ordinance really undermine the intent of this ordinance.\n\nSo I'm just thinking this, I've been struggling with this one.\n\nCouncil Member Muscata has asked me numerous times how I'm gonna vote and I'm deciding here on the dais that I'm actually going to abstain and saying publicly to the folks representing the executive in the audience today that I look forward to having more conversations with them before full council on this issue.\n\nThank you.\n\nThere are no additional thoughts or comments.\n\nCouncil Member Muscata.\n\nThanks, thank you.\n\nAnd thanks again, Madam Chair, for all the work that you've done on the substitute and the work that we will continue to vote on here today.\n\nI think that it's probably unlikely that there will be a number of amendments on the final, the full council vote.\n\nI'm hoping that won't occur as early as next Tuesday given the work that's still to be done to see what is actually in the budget.\n\nThere was a lot of promises made about alternatives and diversion funding being included in the budget, which we don't receive for another two weeks.\n\nSo my hope is that we'll still have time to see that before a final vote, but I'm guessing that we probably won't have that information and if we don't do more amendments at full council, then this might be our last time to vote on this.\n\nI do appreciate though that folks are acknowledging that there does need to be a tough definition or a more refined definition to the threat of harm.\n\nThe language is in the bill at this point with the sub.\n\nWhat this amendment does is just offer additional clarity to make sure that when we use the words and definition threat of harm, that we have a means to ensure that there is a base level of protection for true threats that is consistent with that state law.\n\nAnd I think that it's especially important to remember that while the consent decree is being lifted, the city of Seattle still is receiving national and state and local headlines for having bias arrests.\n\nAnd Seattle Times 2021 in July headline says, report Seattle police stop black people, Native Americans at far higher rate than white people.\n\nIf that level of bias policing is occurring currently, and we add on to the fact that more people of color are more likely to be unhoused, and if this is really affecting mostly folks who are going to be unhoused and consuming in public, then I think we are doubling down on the potential that there will be additional bias and who is then swept into additional arrests under this new law.\n\nSo again, it is currently illegal to consume in public, but if we are giving further guidance to officers, we should be offering them guidance to not just default to a personal feeling of being unsafe and really have a clear definition of what threat of harm truly is.\n\nThat is why I think it's so important to put that in the legislation here today.\n\nAnd obviously there's many more avenues that we need to continue to address that, not just with this legislation, but I offered that evidence as recently as July of 2021, as offered in the Seattle Times reporting on that watchdog report showing officers, despite nearly a decade of surveillance under the federal oversight entity, continue to stop and use force against black people in the city and Native American folks in the city far more often than white people.\n\nAnd that's a direct quote.\n\nThank you, Madam Chair.\n\nThank you.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson, is that a new hand?\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nYou have four.\n\nI wanna note that I am not struggling at all with my vote on this amendment because it seems to be saying that being exposed and inhaling secondhand fentanyl smoke is not bad enough for officer intervention.\n\nI know that it's being made to sound more complicated, but I don't think that that is a reason for not intervening in public use of drugs in a public place.\n\nSo here we have Reverend Walden here who has spoken publicly about her exposure to fentanyl smoke and I'm just gonna have to say that when you're talking about grabbing headlines, I think that passage of this will grab headlines as well because we're questioning whether or not that is harmful enough.\n\nAnd that is not being what former representative Don Mason says, being a hero.\n\nSo I will be voting no.\n\nThis goes too down a complex rabbit hole for me to vote yes on this.\n\nThank you.\n\nMadam Chair, I just final comment if I might.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nMadam Chair, that proves the point.\n\nAnd that proves the point that this amendment is incredibly important, that we can't rely on people's feelings of being unsafe.\n\nWe have to have a clear definition of what is truly a harm to one's physical safety.\n\nPublic Health Seattle King County and the Washington State Poison Control Center have put out data on their public health sites helping to explain to members of the public that consuming secondhand fentanyl smoke is not a physical harm.\n\nI am not saying it is not something that I wish on anyone, but it is not reason to arrest someone.\n\nThat is what we are trying to define here right now.\n\nWhether or not physical harm is clearly defined is a very important component of this policy.\n\nAnd whether or not someone feels uncomfortable is absolutely something I care about, but it is not justification for arrest when it is not yielding physical harm according to our own Public Health Department and Poison Control Center.\n\nYou have made my point about why this amendment would be incredibly important as a guardrail for offering sideboards to our officers for what defines physical harm.\n\nThe point has been made not only by me, but apparently other members of the committee who are going to be voting now.\n\nSo I appreciate, Madam Chair, that the conversation may continue in other venues.\n\nAnd I look forward to us all continuing to look at public health publications to remember what defines actual physical harm according to our own public health officers.\n\nThank you.\n\nHearing no further comment, will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of Amendment 2.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nNay.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nNo.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nNo.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nAbstain.\n\nOne yes, three no, one abstention.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nThe motion fails.\n\nThe amendment is not adopted and we will move on to the next amendment, Amendment Number 3, which is sponsored by Council Member Mosqueda and myself.\n\nAgain, we'll get the amendment before us and then we can speak to and debate the merits of Amendment 3.\n\nIs there a motion for Amendment Number 3?\n\nMadam Chair, I move the committee consider Amendment Number 3.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nSecond Amendment Number 3.\n\nAnd now that we have the amendment before us, let's get a quick description from Council Central staff and then we'll speak to it.\n\nOkay.\n\nAmendment Number 3 adds three whereas clauses to the recitals in the bill.\n\nAnd these recitals are intended to communicate that the city does support a framework of diversion and a substantial part of that framework, especially when we're talking about pre -booking diversion is the Let Everyone Advance with Dignity, so the LEAD program.\n\nAnd so as long as they have the ability to sufficiently support this population with diversion and the city continues to prioritize referrals from police at the point of arrest for pre -booking diversion, that the city is supporting that framework.\n\nIt just makes the additional point that if at some point there are insufficient resources for pre -booking diversion and this priority of referral through police is still prioritized, that there is a chance that what we call a pre -arrest or social contact diversion could be compromised in that the number of resources are of course limited.\n\nAnd so any prioritization of contacts through police, through law enforcement, if funding is not sufficient to support both kinds of referral could mean that referral into LEAD is more limited to contact with law enforcement.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nSo let's first hear from the sponsors of the amendment.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda, would you like to speak to it?\n\nYeah, Madam Chair, I'm also happy to let you go first and then I can weigh in.\n\nI know you've been a longtime supporter and advocate for funding for LEAD and appreciate your co -sponsorship on this amendment and maybe I can speak to it afterwards.\n\nSure, I just think - I can go now too.\n\nI'll say a few words.\n\nI think the most important part of this amendment is the fact that we are recognizing here today that our strategy for addressing substance use disorder in public places is really dependent on the ability of programs like LEAD who both are integral to pre -booking and pre -arrest diversion strategies.\n\nThat if we do not make sufficient resources to support those programs, then very likely we will result in a policy where the primary entry into the diversion system is contact with law enforcement.\n\nAssuming that the diversion system itself will be funded because again, there are two types of diversion.\n\nThere's diversion that happens without arrest and there's diversion that happens after arrest but before charges are filed.\n\nIt is incredibly important that we make sure that we are properly resourcing both of these strategies.\n\nAnd it's really important that we go into creating policy with our eyes wide open about the importance of these resources.\n\nSo really appreciate Council Member Mosqueda both as the budget chair and the prime sponsor of this amendment bringing this forward.\n\nSo we have the opportunity to speak about how important this funding is to our community safety continuum while we have representatives of the mayor's office in the audience with us today.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nGreat, thank you very much Madam Chair and thanks again for your leadership.\n\nAlso as vice chair for the budget committee, I think that with you and members of this council, we have had to lead on finding additional funding, one -time funding sources to plug funding gaps in the LEAD program.\n\nWe have been happy to try to do that with the vice chair and other council members over the last few years to ensure that the LEAD program led by our friends who were previously part of the PDA, we wanna make sure that the various programs and strategies that they are deploying to reach people where they are at and to make sure that services are being delivered by trusted community partners whose relationships take time and investment that they have the funding.\n\nSo we have spent the last three years finding one -time funding sources to plug that gap at LEAD.\n\nWithout seeing the budget before this bill comes forward, I don't have any assurances that there is going to be the funding gap filled again.\n\nAccording to PDA and LEAD, they felt that they had to absorb about an $8 million gap in the 2023 budget before we were able to find additional funding to plug some of that last year.\n\nAnd they are projecting that they will need to have somewhere between six to $8 million more in next year's budget, thinking that they can absorb possibly a $2 million gap to accept all of SPD referrals.\n\nBut if the funding gap from last year is the same, it will start to impugn our ability to actually do what this bill purports that it will do.\n\nIf we don't fill this funding gap, it will harm LEAD and PDA's ability to accept referrals, which are the centerpiece of what supposedly makes this bill different from previous iterations.\n\nAnd we have to have that funding accounted for to ensure that LEAD has the diversion capacity to ensure that people are not being arrested first.\n\nThe pre -arrest diversion component of this legislation is truly what makes it stand out and is unique, and that requires funding.\n\nI look forward to working with members of this council and the executive to ensure that that funding gap is not experienced again this year, but anywhere near the expected funding gap for 2024 will result in a cut in their ability to accept all SPD referrals.\n\nWe have a big budget deficit in the hundreds of millions of dollars coming up after next year.\n\nEveryone knows that.\n\nEveryone should have that front and center.\n\nAnd I know CBO and the executive do have that front and center.\n\nThat is why I'm concerned with any ability to add millions of dollars to programs and to especially ensure that we are doubling down on policy that assumes that money will be there.\n\nMakes me nervous about the ability to fulfill the promise that's being outlined here.\n\nGiven that we don't have an answer yet on the budget, there is not room for someone in, sorry.\n\nGiven that we don't have answers on what happens when there is not room for someone in diversion, even though we've tried to guard against that by including language in this legislation saying that when there is no room in the appropriate treatment, that is not a reason to arrest people.\n\nI'm still very concerned about the policy without the funding attached.\n\nLEAD has assured us that their current level of funding, that they are prepared to prioritize their services.\n\nThey will prioritize all SPD referrals so that no one needs to be turned away for lack of access to diversion programming.\n\nHowever, again, it makes it so effectively that the only entry point to LEAD is by a police officer as they will need to scale down other referrals they accept to ensure that there's proportional increase to SPD referrals.\n\nSo my hope here is that we can sustain and expand LEAD diversion capacity with this amendment.\n\nBut again, I wanna emphasize the importance of this actually having the funding in the budget to make sure that this is not a false promise.\n\nAnd I would very much prefer to see the budget before we advance the policy.\n\nI'm hoping that this policy amendment here helps to align our goals and future work on the budget.\n\nThank you, Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nI'll be brief on this amendment.\n\nJust wanna speak to my personal experience of working with law enforcement assisted diversion as a public safety partner, particularly in the downtown core of the city.\n\nI really do think we have shown a way in Seattle to have this really fundamental leg of the stool as a public safety service that complements fire, police and emergency medical technicians in a way that adds new capacity, that is harm reduction informed, that is focused on root causes.\n\nWorking during the COVID era on encampment resolutions with Just Care, a program of the Public Defender Association in partnership with other organizations was a really eyeopening policy experience for me.\n\nThere are still hotel shelters that the co -lead team is operating in the city of Seattle that have saved lives, that have gotten people into housing, that have made our community safer.\n\nAnd that they have kept those hotel shelters well run and with good relations with the surrounding community where the sheltering program themselves has also not been a contributor to perceptions of public order or public safety.\n\nAnd they've been good neighbors and actually improved public safety demonstrated by 911 data in the areas where they have cited their sheltering.\n\nI really think it's important to highlight and elevate this work because it is fundamental to the approach that we as a council and mayor are centering with this legislation and very enthusiastically support this amendment and look forward to moving on to the budget cycle where we can start talking about how to continue to adequately resource lead to have the impact that we want it to have.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nThank you, Chair Herbold.\n\nAnd I appreciate the intent of this because you need to have the funding backing the alternatives.\n\nAnd my concern here is that we're calling out a single organization which could imply a sole source award of funding.\n\nIn the future, this is gonna be, we're referencing a Seattle Municipal Code update that we're doing.\n\nAnd so I wonder if the authors of this would be willing, and maybe if it's not today, at full council, but to basically just change, say, the let everyone advance with dignity lead program or similar programs, just so it's not just calling out one organization forever as if that would be the only organization to ever receive this.\n\nI mean, we may wanna be growing that ecosystem, having more nonprofits doing this work on top of the great work that LEAD has done.\n\nMaybe the Human Services Department will do some of this directly.\n\nI just don't know.\n\nAnd I just wouldn't wanna call out just a single organization.\n\nSo there could be an amendment just saying, or other programs that would satisfy me.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd just to respond to that, this is a common theme that we hear over having similar conversations with King County.\n\nThe organization that is the project manager is the PDA, but LEAD is not an organization.\n\nLEAD is a program that could be, that has particular components of the program that make it have fidelity with the approach that we know works.\n\nThere are dozens and dozens of LEAD programs throughout the country.\n\nPDA doesn't run them all everywhere.\n\nBut again, LEAD is a model.\n\nAnd it is a model that result, that is dependent on somebody acting as program manager and several providers working under that program management to deliver care and services.\n\nSo given that we don't, LEAD does not have to be operated by PDA.\n\nIt can be operated by anybody.\n\nAnd currently King County has just done an RFP for LEAD, opening it up to other applicants to deliver the services in the program model that has fidelity with the LEAD program.\n\nAnd so that fidelity with those principles is incredibly important.\n\nAnd that's why we refer to LEAD in the amendment itself.\n\nAnd just to make a finer point on it, the RFP that the county recently did for the LEAD program was open to other people to apply, not just the PDA.\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nAny other comments or questions?\n\nThanks, Madam Chair.\n\nI would just also note that we're talking about recitals, right?\n\nPlaces where we note findings.\n\nIt is noted here as a finding that the framework of the LEAD program is efficient and effective.\n\nAnd that is, I think, a difference than of the type of amendment we're talking about here.\n\nOften when we do amendments in the budget and we're trying to be prescriptive to departments about what needs funding, we will say programs such as LEAD or entities such as PDA.\n\nSo I understand the point.\n\nThank you, Council Member Peterson, and agree with you in concept on when we're dealing with the budget.\n\nBut here I think we're talking about the type of programs that are required to ensure the effectiveness of the referral program and the diversion strategies that are going to make this a different approach.\n\nAnd I think it's appropriate in the whereas's to note LEAD as a program that has proven track record.\n\nI also though wanna, again, underscore the importance here of us waiting on acting on this legislation until we have assurances that that funding is directed in the budget.\n\nHowever, the executive decides to write that as some sort of assurances that the other half or the counter to the proposal here is truly funded.\n\nBut I appreciate the clarification, Madam Chair, that you offered and just wanted to offer that as well given that this is in the recitals.\n\nThank you, Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nI'm not seeing any additional comments or questions.\n\nClerk, please call the roll on adoption of Amendment 3.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nAbstain.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nAbstain.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nYes.\n\nThree yes, two abstentions.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nThe motion carries.\n\nThe amendment is adopted.\n\nWe can move on to the next amendment, Amendment Number 4.\n\nAlso sponsored by Council Member Mosqueda and myself.\n\nLet's get it in front of us.\n\nIs there a motion to move forward Amendment 4?\n\nI will move Amendment 4.\n\nIs there a second?\n\nSecond.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt's been moved and seconded to adopt Amendment 4.\n\nCould Council Central staff please describe the amendment?\n\nRight.\n\nProposed Amendment 4 to Council Bill 120645 would add into the legislation reference to the RCW Section 10 .05, which is a deferred prosecution statute.\n\nThe amendment adds a couple recitals just describing the addition and the reasons why.\n\nBut what this essentially would do would incorporate into 12A -09 -020, which is the part of the bill that adopts RCW sections.\n\nThe state legislature's deferred prosecution program.\n\nIn addition, it provides in that section additional guidance for offenses other than those referenced in RCW 10 .05, which are domestic violence offenses, traffic infractions, and criminal mistreatment offenses.\n\nAnd so this is intended to apply to all other misdemeanors and gross misdemeanors that specifically have a nexus to, sorry, a nexus between defendant's conduct and an underlying substance use disorder and or a mental health disorder.\n\nAnd it provides some guidance to the court about how to use deferred prosecution in those circumstances.\n\nI just note that this is not mandating the municipal court to do any deferred prosecution cases.\n\nIt's just providing some legislative guidance about how to do things like treatment terms for deferred prosecution cases.\n\nIt matches the requirements for periodic reporting to the court and prosecutor, as well as the defense on the defendant's progress.\n\nAnd it makes sure that admissions made by a defendant in the course of receiving deferred prosecution can't be used against the defendant in the prosecution's case.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda, would you like to speak to the amendment?\n\nSure, thank you.\n\nAnd again, thanks for your partnership on this, Madam Chair.\n\nI just wondered as well for the viewing public if we wanted to pull it up on the screen to share some of the content of the amendment.\n\nIt was also published with the agenda.\n\nSo thank you so much to everyone who made that possible.\n\nI wanna just note my interest in this, adding to what Asha said very briefly, by resolving at least some cases more quickly than traditional prosecution and tailoring conditions to connect individuals facing charges who are suffering from substance use disorders and or mental health disorders with services in a timely manner.\n\nThis tool can help reduce recidivism and promote public safety.\n\nThe proposed deferred prosecution process would allow judges to set individual conditions for each person in front of them and then dismiss the case once they determine a person has successfully met conditions set by the court.\n\nAnd I know, Madam Chair, you've spent a lot of time working on this as well, or this concept.\n\nSo I appreciate your work on this.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nJust a couple words to add to Asha's explanation in your words, Council Member Esqueda.\n\nUnder this law, we assume that some people will be diverted without being arrested.\n\nSome people will be diverted after arrest, but before booking.\n\nAnd some people will not be diverted.\n\nAnd so this creates an opportunity for the use of an existing deferred prosecution program in order to, again, reduce the negative impacts of the criminal legal system.\n\nAs Asha explained, the program does not mandate the municipal court to take any specific mandatory actions within a specific timeframe.\n\nAnd we recognize that the ability of the Seattle Municipal Court to stand up a deferred prosecution program is contingent on resources.\n\nBut this is simply proposed to allow for another approach to reduce the negative impacts of the criminal legal system of folks that there is a prosecution moving forward.\n\nAnd it's specifically and narrowly focused on those individuals where there's a nexus between an individual's behavior and the substance use disorder with the underlying charge.\n\nSo again, I appreciate Council Member Mosqueda for being the prime sponsor on this one.\n\nAnd I'm also very supportive of, again, creating opportunities for diversion across the continuum.\n\nLet's see if we have other comments.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis, I think you were first in the queue.\n\nThank you so much, Chair Herbold.\n\nI think this is a really intriguing amendment.\n\nWhen I was an assistant city attorney, I did have cases that resolved as a deferred prosecution.\n\nDeferred prosecutions are not the most common diversion that we use in the municipal court.\n\nI actually think that they're very uncommon because the terms and conditions of a deferred prosecution are very intensive.\n\nTypically applied in DUIs, as the description of the amendment implies.\n\nRequires intensive outpatient drug and alcohol treatment.\n\nTypically requires complete sobriety as one of the conditions of completing the program.\n\nSo it is not typically something that people who are charged in the municipal court seek to take advantage of for a DUI unless the evidence is pretty significant and they're willing to engage in that intensive program.\n\nThere's a high rate of failure for deferred prosecutions.\n\nSo from that standpoint, just for members of the public, just to state it, a deferred prosecution is a great opportunity for people to take advantage of, but it is not easy for people to do.\n\nBut I do think it could apply to cases like this, situations like this, where there is a nexus with addiction for folks.\n\nThat said, that is not currently what is allowed per the RCWs which control, the RCW which controls the applicability of how deferred prosecutions in Washington State work.\n\nSo I am not really sure how, through our municipal code, we would be able to facilitate this.\n\nBut what I think that this does put before the council in an interesting way is maybe a conversation around how some supplemental work could be done at the state level to look at ways to apply deferred prosecutions to these cases as one of the tools or tactics that the state wants courts of limited jurisdiction to be able to provide in these cases.\n\nMight be something to look into and talk to our legislative delegation about.\n\nBut there are other diversion and other things short of going to trial that we do have as part of our practice locally that might be more appropriate, like pre -filed diversion, which in our supplemental budget we recently increased.\n\nSo given that this particular concept is kind of coming a little later in our process too, I'm gonna vote no on this amendment today, but I think it does invite a policy conversation we should engage with the legislature about for this being one of the tools that we can potentially use.\n\nThank you, Council Member Lewis.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nWell, I actually like the deferred prosecution program because it is rigorous and despite what Council Member Lewis just said about it not working for everyone, it worked for my dad and that's how he got sober.\n\nSo just wanted to note that this is an effective program for enough people to save enough lives for me to be in support of it.\n\nOn August 14th, I referenced a letter we had received from the Department of Public Defense and SEIU 925 stating their staunch opposition to aligning with state law and asking that it be amended, the proposed legislation, that it be amended to grant Seattle Municipal Court judges the authority to divert cases for treatment.\n\nAnd back then I said that that would be illegal because the power to create a judicial diversion program is vested solely in the state legislature under Article 4, Sections 1 and 12 of the Washington State Constitution and the Seattle Municipal Court jurisdiction and power is derived from the legislature per RCW 3520.\n\nAnd so basically that was a way for me to say that we don't have the authority to do that.\n\nNow this amendment doesn't create a whole new judicial diversion program, instead it expands an existing one, but that too is an impermissible change to state law which is beyond Council's authority.\n\nSo I'm gonna be voting no against this\n\nBut\n\nI also want to say that from the get -go I've been saying that I will oppose any attempt to interfere with the city attorney's prosecutorial discretion and this does do that.\n\nIt is an attempt to usurp those decisions and so that's, I'm maintaining consistency and will be voting no for that reason as well.\n\nThank you, Council Member Nelson.\n\nThere any other closing comments on Amendment 4? Madam Chair.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda, yes.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nYou know, I just, I wonder if there's any comments from central staff about the concern about the legality or the approach here.\n\nObviously every amendment that we put forward goes through the law department.\n\nThis one has, it has not been walked on.\n\nThis is not coming in late.\n\nIt's part of the normal process where it went through the law legal review.\n\nAnd we have on central staff our own legal analysis, analysts also who assured us that it is consistent with state law.\n\nSo just to make sure that we have clarification on the legislation or the amendment in front of us, it might be helpful to hear from central staff if there's any feedback on some of the concerns raised.\n\nYes, and I think it's, we do need to be careful about talking about legal advice, whether or not we're talking about legal advice from the city attorney or legal advice from the council, council, but handing it over to council central staff if they have anything to add.\n\nYeah, I just have to refer you back to the memos from the city attorney's office and any information from our legislative council that they've provided to you in privileged form.\n\nI'm afraid I can't speak too much more than that.\n\nThank you, Asha.\n\nAppreciate that.\n\nThank you.\n\nAll right, not seeing any further comments.\n\nPausing, still none.\n\nOkay, with that, please call the roll on the adoption of amendment four.\n\nCouncil member Mosqueda.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil member Nelson.\n\nNo.\n\nVice chair Lewis.\n\nNo.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nYes.\n\nTwo yes, three no.\n\nI don't think you called all committee members.\n\nYeah, yes.\n\nSorry.\n\nAnd just to get everybody's vote on the record.\n\nChair Herbold, yes.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd I don't know if you got council member Peterson, but I'm a no.\n\nOh, you skipped you too.\n\nMy apologies.\n\nAll right, well.\n\nAm I that predictable, Newell?\n\nMe too.\n\nIt's what happens when he's filling in the answers before the vote.\n\nThe motion fails and the amendment is not adopted.\n\nLet's move on to amendment number five.\n\nCouncil member Peterson.\n\nSo this amendment, again, sponsored by council member Peterson.\n\nLet's get it in front of us.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you, chair.\n\nColleagues, I move to adopt amendment five to council bill 120645 as shown on the committee's agenda.\n\nSecond.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt's been moved and seconded to adopt amendment five.\n\nCould council central staff please describe the amendment?\n\nSo amendment five to council bill 120645.\n\nIt adds some recitals that speak to some of the proposed amendment language.\n\nEssentially what this amendment asks is that the officer of the inspector general for public safety or a research -based organization that OIG chooses to engage with, as well as SPD, work with the city attorney's office, the Seattle municipal court, the fire department, and any other relevant departments to obtain data that I'll describe in this next subsection and provide that data to the council by January 1st, 2025 and for the next few years up until 2030.\n\nThe intent for the data collection is for OIG to take a look at the data that's described in subsections one through 12 with the intent of using that data and any other data that they think is necessary to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of this ordinance.\n\nThe intent is for OIG to provide recommendations both about data collection, to the extent that any of the data that SPD or other departments are collecting is operationally difficult and provide some recommendations about how to better operationalize that data collection to help the city to improve how it would assess the effectiveness of the ordinance.\n\nThe preliminary report is requested by June 30th of 2025 and final written recommendations are intended to come to the council by the end of the year in 2025 and then annually again until 2030.\n\nJust to note about the timing there, the intent is for OIG to be able to look at a year's worth of data and so assuming that this, if this ordinance were to pass, it would be able to look at the data collected throughout 2024 to be able to assess the effectiveness of the legislation.\n\nAs noted in the amendment itself, there's 12 different areas of data collection.\n\nWe're looking at the number of drug overdoses on a quarterly basis, the number of shootings in which drugs were present or an individual was under the influence of drugs on a quarterly basis, the number of 911 calls about the use of controlled substances in public also on a quarterly basis and all of those are intended to be data collection from between 2019 through 2023.\n\nThe number of documented contacts between officers that includes community service officers and individuals encountered in enforcing these crimes, the number of attempts by police officers to contact and coordinate efforts for diversion, outreach and other alternatives, the number of arrests for the crimes, the number of individuals that are transported for booking at the jail of that number, those who are actually booked into jail, those that the jail did not accept, those individuals transported to a medical facility instead of being booked into jail and those released without being booked or being transported to a medical facility.\n\nFrom the city attorney's office, the number of possession and public use cases that are referred for prosecution, the number of cases from the number that are referred that are dismissed before or during trial and that would include pre -filing diversion, the reasons for dismissal of those cases, the results of any interviews that OIG conducts with SPD personnel who have experience in the field enforcing this legislation and then any other information that OIG thinks would be helpful for the purposes of conducting this review.\n\nThe last piece of this addition is asking SPD officers to collect to the extent that it's practicable for them, contact with individuals in pursuit of enforcement of these crimes as well as the number of attempts to contact and coordinate diversion efforts.\n\nIf SPD can't collect that data, SPD and OIG will try and figure out collecting data from service providers.\n\nI'll turn it back over to Council Member Peterson.\n\nThank you.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nThank you.\n\nI wanna thank central staff and the Office of Inspector General for their hard work and collaboration in crafting this amendment for me so that it can truly be helpful for everyone.\n\nColleagues, this amendment requests our Office of Inspector General to lead the effort to collect and share data with the public and the city council to assess the effectiveness of this new legislation including how the mayor's unique provisions regarding harm and diversion impact SPD's ability to do its job.\n\nThis amendment asks for recommendations to approve this policy in the future if warranted.\n\nAnd for better or worse, this new legislation forges new ground and puts Seattle in a unique and untested situation different from the compromise the state government crafted four months ago.\n\nSo due to that uncertainty on whether that legislation will be effective in real life, I believe collecting and reporting this information is a sensible addition.\n\nAnd as central staff noted, this would eventually sunset so this does not go on forever.\n\nSo passing this amendment on reporting is very important for me to support this legislation overall.\n\nSo thank you for your consideration.\n\nThank you.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nLooking to see if there are additional comments.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis.\n\nThank you, Chair Herbold.\n\nVery strongly support this amendment from Council Member Peterson.\n\nI think as a general practice, we as a council should incorporate feedback loop amendments like this into more work that we do that triggers services from the Office of the Inspector General or for non -public safety related matters from the city auditor as a way to foster a climate of ongoing improvement and ongoing reflection on policies and priorities.\n\nAnd this information around data collection and lining up that accountability comports with what I think we should be doing more broadly.\n\nSo I support this amendment and appreciate Council Member Peterson bringing it forward.\n\nThank you, Council Member Lewis.\n\nJust wanna speak to my support for the amendment as well.\n\nAppreciate the focus on data collection and also want to reference that I did speak to the Inspector General and she is supportive of doing this work as well, which is important to my support.\n\nSo with that, if there are no additional comments or questions, will the clerk please call Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAnd thanks to Council Member Peterson for the data collection amendment.\n\nThere is some work that we wanted to do together in the upcoming budget around data collection, but this amendment, and I went back to look at it again after our conversation this morning, this amendment is not just about the data.\n\nI think that there's unnecessary language that tries to rehash the conversation that we had this spring in reference to the other bill that had zero committee hearings, no opportunity for true community engagement.\n\nAnd it just doesn't seem necessary to include that language in this.\n\nLike what we're doing is just focusing on the data that needs to be collected.\n\nSo I think I'm gonna be a no on this amendment.\n\nIt sounds like there's the votes there, but I do look forward to working with the sponsor of this amendment on upcoming language that we're collectively working on for additional data in other arenas as well.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThere's no further comment.\n\nI'd love to get to the vote.\n\nMr. Cooper.\n\nCouncil Member Herbold.\n\nSorry, just one note on process.\n\nI realized that this amendment is drafted to amend the bill as introduced rather than the substitute.\n\nSo when you're voting on it, if you could just have it be an amendment to the substitute, I can make all the appropriate reference corrections.\n\nAll right.\n\nWill the clerk please call Madam Chair?\n\nI think that there has to be a motion to change the motion.\n\nI don't know that there does.\n\nI think if I call for the vote with the reference to the substitute, we're good.\n\nI'm seeing nodding heads at the table.\n\nCouncil Member Skada, there are nodding heads at the table.\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nWill the clerk please call the roll on amendment five, version one as an amendment to the substitute?\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nNo.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nYes.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nYes.\n\nFour yes, one no.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe motion carries and the amendment is adopted.\n\nAnd we have a couple of amendments that are walk -ons that were not on the agenda for today.\n\nBut we will definitely hear them if the sponsor is planning on bringing them forward.\n\nAll right.\n\nSo I think we'll, I was uncertain whether or not you were intending to bring them forward.\n\nAnd if there's -\n\nYeah, I'll move them if you would like.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo we will still move them and get them in front of us because we do intend to vote on them contrary to the uncertainty that you had expressed at the beginning.\n\nSo, all right.\n\nCause I just wanted to, if you weren't intending to do so but still wanted to talk to them, I was trying to create space to talk to the amendments without getting them in front of us.\n\nAnd I hear you.\n\nSo I don't think that any space needs to be created if I'm not gonna try to vote.\n\nSo next up is amendment six sponsored by Council Member Nelson.\n\nCan I have a motion please?\n\nI move adoption of amendment six to the substitute.\n\nAll right.\n\nIt's been moved and seconded to adopt amendment number six.\n\nCould council central staff please describe the amendment?\n\nSo amendment six, sorry.\n\nAmendment six would make one change to the section about threat of harm to others and the assessment that the officer needs to make.\n\nAs you'll see reflected in the language, instead of officers will determine whether the individual through their actions and conduct presents a threat of harm to others, that will language is changed to may and in moving it from mandatory to discretionary language, no longer mandates that the officer make such an assessment.\n\nTurn it back over to Council Member Nelson.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson, would you like to speak to your amendment?\n\nYes, so thank you.\n\nI indicated earlier that although the proposed substitute clarifies that the threat of harm assessment is not an element of the crime, the adequacy of the assessment may be raised at trial and could jeopardize the criminal prosecution or later expose the city.\n\nThat's what I was trying to get at.\n\nI now have a script that I'm allowed to say.\n\nI believe the present version creates an unacceptable level of risk for the city.\n\nI'm not going to go into attorney -client privileged advice, but that here are the practical concerns for officers and prosecutors that my amendments seek to relieve.\n\nThey include, one, burdens and confusion for the prosecution of criminal cases, two, time burdens and confusion for officers that are trying to enforce our laws, and three, and generally bad consequences and risks for implementation.\n\nI've talked to my colleagues and attorneys and believe these amendments reduce the challenges that I see.\n\nAnd I'm referring to this one and the following one.\n\nSo basically, because the assessment of the threat of harm could lead to some unintended consequences, I am proposing, even though the new version of the substitute is better that you circulated this morning, I am proposing removing the mandatory directive to determine the threat of harm by changing it from will to may.\n\nThank you, Council Member Nelson.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis, I see your hand is up.\n\nThank you, Council Member Herbold.\n\nI'm actually inclined, I'll speak to both amendments six and seven, which do similar things in one set of remarks.\n\nI'm actually inclined to support these amendments for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that, as has been well established, although it's not universally accurately reported, the City Council cannot order the police to do anything.\n\nThe mayor and the chief of police direct the policy at the discretion of the department and not the City Council.\n\nSo the language that we put into statute, whether it is will or may, is gonna have the same practical effect in terms of the feedback that we are providing to the department.\n\nThe second consideration is related to the first in that we know that this ordinance is going to kick off complementing executive actions that the mayor's office and the police department are going to be pursuing, that we call out in the ordinance and that have been part of our process over the last couple of months.\n\nSo to the extent that more prescriptive language that we have been workshopping and working with constituencies on is warranted, that language would probably be better reflected in executive policy rather than in the ordinance itself.\n\nSo for those reasons, I think that this language helps to provide that flexibility given that we know in advance what the intent of the executive is going to be in these enforcement and in how they want to enforce the ordinance.\n\nWe know in advance what the strategy is going to be from Mayor Harrell.\n\nAnd the more prescriptive language could be included in those actions and that's probably a better place to put them.\n\nSo for that reason, I think that this language better reflects what the role of the council should be in this and continues to complement the overall strategy that we're pursuing.\n\nThank you, Council Member Lewis.\n\nOther comments?\n\nI have a few comments myself.\n\nI feel like the language, I appreciate where this is coming from, but I think throughout this, we have talked about the threat of harm standard being an exercise of discretion.\n\nAnd we expect our officers to use their discretion and to make these determinations.\n\nI'm just concerned that the message that this sends is that the use of discretion is discretionary.\n\nAnd that is not my intention for this policy.\n\nI appreciate that the policies, as Council Member Lewis say, may be the more appropriate place to define the discretionary decision -making that the executive is directing police officers to make.\n\nBut I feel like inserting the word may where currently the word will is included is suggesting that the use of discretion is discretionary.\n\nAnd police officers make decisions based on their assessment of the totality of the circumstances, including how the unlawful acts are affecting others and surroundings.\n\nAnd I feel that inserting the word may here suggests that we don't actually want police officers to use discretion.\n\nAnd I don't feel that that's the intent of the ordinance.\n\nLooking for other comments or questions.\n\nNot seeing any.\n\nPlease call the roll.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nNo.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nYes.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nNo.\n\nThree yes, two no.\n\nThank you, the motion carries and the amendment is adopted.\n\nNext up is Amendment 7, also sponsored by Council Member Nelson.\n\nIs there a motion?\n\nI move the adoption of Amendment 7 to the substitute.\n\nSecond.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt has been moved and seconded to adopt Amendment 7.\n\nCould central staff please describe the amendment?\n\nAmendment number 7 to Council Bill 120645.\n\nSimilarly, it moves language that would have required an officer to attempt to contact and coordinate efforts for diversion, outreach, or other alternatives to arrest from mandatory to discretionary, and strikes the reference to the reasonable attempt and just leaves the language as an officer may attempt to contact and coordinate efforts.\n\nIt strikes language that was included in the substitute that would, excuse me, exempt officers from such a requirement if the appropriate or most viable care strategy is transport.\n\nIt includes language that adds an officer may arrest at their discretion to avoid additional self -harm.\n\nAnd lastly, it strikes language that would have asked SPD policies or training to identify what additional articulable facts and circumstances would warrant arrest in the section in which the ordinance states that the officer would not arrest unless the individual poses a threat of harm to self absent those facts and circumstances.\n\nTurn it back over to Council Member Nelson.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nAgain, same argument as above.\n\nI am changing mandatory to discretionary language with may, and the other items in here are, I think, confusing.\n\nThey confuse the officer's decision in the moment, and they confuse what we are expecting them to do.\n\nIt just creates so many different options for actions that I think that it just makes this law very complex.\n\nAnd so that is why I put this forward.\n\nThank you, Council Member Nelson.\n\nOther comments?\n\nSeeing no comments, will the clerk please call the roll on the amendment?\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nNo.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nYes.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nNo.\n\nThree yes, two no.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThe amendment is adopted, and we now have the underlying bill before us.\n\nWe have considered amendments, and now let's return to the main motion.\n\nAre there further comments on Council Bill 1206 .45 as amended?\n\nCouncil Member Lewis.\n\nThat is an old hand, Chair Herbold, but I will make just a couple of closing remarks.\n\nAppreciate the process this morning of going through a comprehensive array of amendments that touch lots of different aspects of this policy.\n\nReally looking forward to bringing this conversation to full council and the subsequent conversations around the complementing executive actions that we have been discussing.\n\nWith our partners in the mayor's office.\n\nI want to thank Camila Brown and my staff for staffing my office through this process.\n\nI want to thank Mayor Harrell for his leadership in convening a broad array of stakeholders in law enforcement, public health, to hammer out this proposal.\n\nAnd I want to thank Director Meyerberg for being the primary staffer in the mayor's office for working this policy through in a very engaging and collegial way with a very diverse array of people who don't always agree on things and doing it with consummate skill.\n\nSo with that, I'll reserve the balance of my remarks for when we discuss this at full council, but appreciate the process.\n\nChair Herbold, this morning, and look forward to final action.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis, Council Member Peterson.\n\nThank you, Chair Herbold.\n\nColleagues, I'm sure it comes as no surprise that I wish the city council had simply voted for the conforming legislation that Council Member Nelson and I crafted with the city attorney, Anne Davison, on June 6th, more than three months ago, to implement the public health and public safety compromise crafted by our democratic governor and state legislature.\n\nBut our local effort to simply implement the state compromise failed by a vote of four votes in favor, five votes against.\n\nAnd so here we are, even though cities across the state have adopted the state's public safety law.\n\nI appreciate our mayor and his team stepping up to craft revised legislation.\n\nAll the people who served on the task force who leaned into this so that we could earn additional support from the city council because I believe it's not acceptable for the city of Seattle to remain an outlier on this public health and safety legislation.\n\nWe're overdue for getting these provisions into our Seattle Municipal Code.\n\nI believe that the amendments adopted by our Public Safety Committee today make this legislation better.\n\nI'm especially grateful for the adoption of my amendment to require additional data and reporting so that policymakers will have the information they need to assess whether the legislation is working or not.\n\nSo I'll be voting yes today on this amended legislation and also open to additions during the debate at full council.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you, Council Member Peterson.\n\nA few words for myself as the sponsor of this legislation.\n\nI want to thank the mayor's office for the collaboration on the bill.\n\nI want to thank council members on this committee for their work on the bill.\n\nWe, again, know that state law applies in the city of Seattle and it has applied in the city of Seattle.\n\nThis law is in effect, but this, well, the state law is in effect, but this law, the law before us today, again, states that diversion is the preferred approach and this takes place before any arrest in many cases.\n\nAn earlier update states that the police department, shall collect data on the racial composition of those arrested and diverted, booked and referred for prosecution.\n\nDiversion services, such as lead, reach, and we deliver care are key elements to the success of this approach.\n\nI do have some concerns with the late breaking amendments to the bill, but again, since the bill states throughout that diversion is the preferred policy approach and it refers both to diversion that happens before arrest and diversion that happens after arrest, the concern that I have about the change of the words will to may in several places and how that might impact officer discretion.\n\nI look forward to discussing the impact of those changes with the executive and how they intend to administer the program.\n\nAgain, the fact that we have said throughout the bill in multiple places that diversion is the preferred approach and that in order to implement any type of diversion, officer discretion must be used.\n\nI think given that, that is, makes me feel like the changes in the, in amendments six and seven are really functionally designed to address legal concerns that we've heard as the sponsor said and will not change the underlying impact of the bill, which is to create a framework for officer discretion that is necessary to implement any type of diversion program, whether pre -arrest or post -arrest.\n\nSo with that, I'm looking to see if there are any other comments.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nI see your hand is up.\n\nThank you, Madam Chair.\n\nYou know, I want to start with where I think that there's universal interest across the council and across the community.\n\nAnd where I think that there's universal interest and common ground is trying to help people who are in a moment of public health crisis and have addiction as a public health issue that they are addressing.\n\nI think there's universal interest in making sure that people, whether they're in the community or whether they're living unhoused or housed, have access to services that they need to get sober and to get stable and to use the tools at our disposal to try to get more people into the healthcare they need.\n\nI hear people say that.\n\nI hear the universal concepts around that.\n\nBut that is not what we are doing today.\n\nWhat we are doing today does not universally address this common ground to try to get us to get more people into the services they need.\n\nIt is doubling down on a state strategy that is already in statute.\n\nIt is already the law of Seattle and the law of the state that you cannot consume in public.\n\nAnd officers already have the direction to arrest people for what the state has decided is illegal behavior.\n\nWhat we could be doing instead today is investing in where it sounds like there's universal interest in supporting the Public Defenders Association and the LEAD program to support more people getting into pre -arrest diversion strategies, to get into getting clinical health services, into getting into public health treatment programs.\n\nWe know we don't have the infrastructure currently to do that.\n\nWe could be spending our time working across community and across this council and with the executive to invest funds and stand up programs and to support the crisis center levy that just passed to expedite the services that universally people say they want.\n\nI want people to get access to public health services just as much as the people who testified in support of this legislation say they want.\n\nBut that is not what this legislation does.\n\nAnd without the funding that is purported to come with this bill, we have no assurances that there will be the alternative structures and programs and diversion strategies to prevent people from going to jail.\n\nWe do not have to pass this legislation.\n\nIt is not a requirement that local jurisdictions codify what the state legislature already passed.\n\nThe conversation that we could be having with King County Prosecutor's Office is about how we could support them with additional resources and services they need instead of offering additional prosecutorial authority to our own city department.\n\nI want us to be spending our time and investments on focusing on how we get people into public health services, not how we double down and recreate a punitive system within our own city to try to prosecute more people.\n\nWithout assurances that there will be funding for LEAD and organizations that support pre -arrest diversion strategies, we are putting the cart before the horse.\n\nWe do not know that these conversations that folks have had about the budget will materialize.\n\nWe cannot be voting on our hopes or rumors or what was the word that was used earlier from my colleague the assurances that have been given without actually seeing the budget to ensure that funding will go in to pre -arrest diversion programs.\n\nWe do know the dangers of arresting people who are dealing with the public health crisis of addiction.\n\nAnd the dangers include death within jails and higher rates of overdose and death when they exit jails.\n\nWe are going to see people suffer more from this public health crisis if we don't compliment this type of policy with the known investments that are needed in public health diversion strategies.\n\nWe are going to see more, especially black, brown and indigenous folks arrested because we have taken away the sideboards that we worked on so hard over the last three to four weeks to try to ensure that bias and a known definition of harm to oneself or others was codified in here.\n\nWe aren't doing that.\n\nWe are taking away these sideboards and we are also putting the cart before the horse before we know that any pre -arrest diversion strategies are actually in place and funded.\n\nWe don't have the language from the executive order.\n\nWe don't have the budget in front of us.\n\nAnd now we've taken away the sideboards that were included in the substitute that the chair worked so hard on.\n\nI was not part of these conversations that indicate that there's any foreshadowing that funding is coming.\n\nI know because I've been involved in the conversations about how bad the budget situation will be in about 14 months.\n\nWe all should be collectively wondering and very curious about where any additional funding is coming from.\n\nAnd to say that there's $27 million being associated with this piece of legislation.\n\nI again wanna clarify for the record that 7 million of that funding comes from funding that is typically used in HSD to fund community priorities.\n\nI understand that there's underfund and $7 million is going to be freed up to go to these efforts.\n\nBut it is false to assume that $27 million is somehow going to materialize in new programs and services being stood up and that there's resources at our fingertips when there is not.\n\nBecause 20 million of those dollars come annually.\n\nAnd once you take out the funding that King County and the city holds back for administrative needs, it's more like $70 ,000 per year.\n\nSo 20 million as a lump sum is not what we're receiving.\n\nIt's actually more like $700 ,000 per year and that shrinks over time.\n\n1 .1 seen in some reporting is inaccurate because again, 20 % of that goes to administrative management both from King County and the city of Seattle.\n\nAnd it doesn't begin to put a dent in the actual type of investments we need.\n\nI am very proud of our county for supporting the crisis care levy.\n\nWe know that that's the type of investments that are needed.\n\nI'm proud of this council for continuing to support programs like LEAD.\n\nI'm proud of the collective work that we've done with the executive over the past few years to scale up investments into LEAD and CoLEAD and REACH in the past.\n\nBut right now we're making policy decisions without knowing what the infrastructure for alternative pre -arrest diversions will look like.\n\nThat doesn't seem very wise when we already know that the outcome will be more people being arrested, more people who are black and brown, more people who are living unsheltered.\n\nAnd what the folks who are consuming outside need is access to services.\n\nThey are not at a point where they are making the cognitive decision to use outside because they are weighing the pros and the cons.\n\nThey are dealing with a public health crisis.\n\nThat is why they are consuming outside.\n\nAnd threatening people with arrest does not mean that more people will make the decision to not use outside.\n\nIt means that more people will get arrested without that pre -arrest diversion program stood up.\n\nI cannot support this program right now or this policy right now, especially not knowing that the pre -arrest diversion programs are going to be fully funded.\n\nI would like to see what the executive order looks like.\n\nI would like to see what the full budget looks like.\n\nAnd I would like those sideboards that we worked so hard to ensure that bias was taken out, to ensure that we were looking at public health data is put back in.\n\nAnd so that we can actually have a known directive on how this policy will be implemented.\n\nAgain, this is not a requirement that local jurisdictions codify what the state legislature has done.\n\nIt is already the law of the land, including in Seattle.\n\nIf we wanna do more to get people off the street who are consuming in public, we should be investing in those pre -arrest diversion programs.\n\nIt does not necessitate this legislation.\n\nIt does necessitate resources.\n\nSo I look forward to working with you all on ensuring that there's the actual resources to support pre -arrest diversion strategies, which does not have to compliment this legislation.\n\nAnd I will be voting no today with a hope to address the actual fundamental root cause of the problem that we're seeing, which is the public health crisis of addiction.\n\nThank you.\n\nI wanna thank you, Madam Chair, as well, and members of the central staff and Melanie Cray on my office because I appreciate the work that you put into the substitute and I don't wanna diminish all the hard work that you put into this, including the hard work that my team members have done.\n\nBut with some of the amendments made today and without seeing that funding, I'm not able to support it.\n\nThank you, Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nI spoke already to my staff in support for the bill of my intent to vote.\n\nYes.\n\nThe other co -sponsor, Council Member Lewis, did.\n\nI did not intend to make any closing remarks.\n\nI don't know if Council Member Lewis intends to make closing remarks.\n\nI did, after hearing your remarks, Council Member Mosqueda, I do feel the need to respond to one thing that you said.\n\nI know when we were discussing Amendment 6 and 7, I was speaking out loud my thought process about the change from will to may.\n\nActually, you characterized the impacts in a way that was consistent with what I was saying when we were discussing the amendment.\n\nBut after further consideration, after we voted on those amendments, I realized that the change of will to may does not undermine the direction of this legislation because the preference, the policy preference for diversion, both pre -arrest diversion and pre -booking diversion is described in many places throughout the bill.\n\nSo that is what is going to carry the day in the development of the policies.\n\nIt is not possible for the police department to finalize policies before we vote on this legislation.\n\nSo that is one reason why I think we haven't seen those policies.\n\nDepartment policies often derive from council legislation.\n\nAnd so it would not be possible for policies to be written in advance of the legislation because we don't know, the executive doesn't know what kind of amendments might be made to the legislation.\n\nSo that's just a little background on the sequencing of events and why it is that we'll be seeing those policies later.\n\nAs it relates to the budget commitments, there's not really a lot that we can do there given that the budget is going to be proposed very, very soon.\n\nI'm hoping that the executive is talking with providers and giving them early assurances of funding commitments that will be in the budget that we'll hear on the 26th.\n\nAnd I will be also looking forward to talking to both the executive and the provider community about how they intend to fulfill the commitments both in this ordinance as well as in the April executive order.\n\nAnd so with that, I would love it if the clerk called the roll on council bill 120645 as amended.\n\nCouncil member Mosqueda.\n\nNo.\n\nCouncil member Nelson.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil member Peterson.\n\nYes.\n\nVice chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nYes.\n\nFour yes, one no.\n\nThank you, the motion carries and the committee recommendation that the bill pass as amended.\n\nWe'll go to, given that this was a split vote, our council rules say that unless there's agreement between the council president and the chair, the bill will be heard on September 26th.\n\nWe typically will skip a full council meeting in order to give other council members who are not on this committee the opportunity to familiarize themselves with why some people voted yes and some people voted no.\n\nThis expectation when there's a split vote is contained in our council rules, but there is a permissive ability to amend those rules if the council president and chair decide to do so.\n\nI will be discussing that, but otherwise our next regularly scheduled public safety and human services committee is scheduled for Tuesday, September 26th.\n\nThis will be the final meeting of this committee before council begins its budget deliberations.\n\nIf committee members anticipate being absent for that meeting in advance of the meeting, we ask that you let us know.\n\nAnd before we adjourn, unless I see other comments, seeing none, it is 12 .45 p .m. and we are adjourned.\n\nThank you everybody.",

          "detail": "The city council meeting focused on discussing and potentially voting on a bill concerning drug possession in public places. Chair Lisa Herbold expressed anger and disappointment over insensitive messaging about a death in recently released body cam footage. Public comments covered topics such as harm reduction, racial disparities in diversion decisions, drug-free zones, the impact of crime and homelessness, and investment in programs supporting individuals affected by drugs. There were differing opinions on the proposed legislation, with some supporting it for public safety reasons and others opposing it for its potential negative impact on marginalized communities and lack of resources for treatment and diversion programs. The meeting highlighted the need for action to address drug use, crime, and homelessness in the city. The council also discussed a bill regarding data collection, with amendments proposed to address concerns about biased policing and officer discretion. Funding for diversion programs and concerns about budget gaps were also discussed. The council decided to wait on acting on the legislation until funding assurances are provided. The meeting concluded with no further comments or discussions.",
          "text": "Thank you very much.\n\nThe September 12, 2023 meeting of the Public Safety and Human Services Committee will come to order.\n\nIt's 11 a .m.\n\nI'm Lisa Herbold, chair of the committee.\n\nClerk, please call the roll.\n\n11 a .m.?\n\n9 .32 a .m.\n\nCouncilmember Mosqueda?\n\nPresent.\n\nCouncilmember Nelson?\n\nPresent.\n\nCouncilmember Peterson?\n\nPresent.\n\nVice Chair Lewis?\n\nPresent.\n\nChair Herbold?\n\nHere.\n\nFive present.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOn today's agenda, we will be hearing one item, Council Bill 120645 regarding possession and public use of controlled substances for discussion and possible vote.\n\nWe'll now approve the agenda for our committee meeting.\n\nAny objections?\n\nSeeing and hearing no objections, today's agenda is adopted.\n\nBefore we move into public comment, I do want to just say a few words.\n\nI feel really compelled to address the recently released body cam footage and audio recording regarding careless and inhumane messaging about the death of Jahavni Kandula.\n\nAppreciate the remarks of Joel Merkel, co -chair of the Community Police Commission, who described this video as heartbreaking, shockingly insensitive, and as damaging to the trust that the department is trying to build with Seattle communities.\n\nWhile I'm angry and disappointed to hear the way that this detective talked about a fatal collision, I'm appreciative that the accountability system is working to find and daylight this type of culture within the department so that we can continue to push to shift and reform the police department.\n\nAs horrifying as this conversation was to hear, I want to also say that I'm thankful to police department employees who discovered this and appropriately escalated these comments through their chain of command to the chief's office, and thankful that Chief Diaz referred the matter to OPA for investigation as the accountability ordinance prescribes.\n\nAnd as we are looking to hire more officers, I think keeping our focus on the types of individuals who see their work as guardians, not warriors, and working to help the department to shift our culture, to seek support, and retain officers with an interest in protecting human life and upholding the peace and well -being of our city.\n\nWith that, we will transition into public comment.\n\nI will moderate the public comment period in the following manner.\n\nEach speaker will be given one minute to speak because of the large number of speakers that we have signed up.\n\nI will alternate between virtual and in -person public commenters.\n\nI will call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council's website in the sign -in form.\n\nIf you've not yet registered to speak, but you'd like to, you can sign up before the end of the public comment session.\n\nOnce I call a speaker's name, if you are using the virtual option, you will hear a prompt and once you've heard that prompt, we ask that you press star six to unmute yourself.\n\nPlease begin by speaking.\n\nPlease begin speaking by stating your name and the item which you are addressing.\n\nAnd speakers will hear a chime when you have 10 seconds left of the allotted time.\n\nOnce you hear that chime, we ask that you begin to wrap up your comments.\n\nIf you do not end your comments at the end of the allotted time provided, unfortunately the speaker's mic will have to be muted after 10 seconds to allow us to hear from the next speaker.\n\nOnce you've completed your public comment, we ask that you disconnect from the line.\n\nAnd if you plan to continue following the meeting, we ask that you do so via the Seattle channel or the listening options that are listed on the agenda.\n\nWe've got 50 people signed up for public comment so far, 10 folks who are signed up virtually and 31 who are signed up in person.\n\nI will alternate between the in -person speakers and the online speakers.\n\nAnd we'll start with some in -person speakers.\n\nLet's start with Tara Moss followed by Latanya Sevier.\n\nGood morning, council members.\n\nIs this one on?\n\nAll right.\n\nI am co -executive director of Purpose, Dignity, Action.\n\nWe operate CoLEAD, which is an intensive case management wing of LEAD Diversion Services.\n\nAnd we also provide project management for LEAD citywide.\n\nThe services offered through LEAD are based on principles of harm reduction because that approach is both humane and often most effective in engaging people on a long recovery journey.\n\nBut while in LEAD, we meet people where they are at and we don't leave them there.\n\nThe goal is to support individuals over a long arc of change that reflects how complicated and nonlinear recovery is for most people.\n\nWe offer a decade of experience showing that it is possible to combine case management based in harm reduction in partnership with the police and prosecutors to accomplish profound transformation for individuals and to benefit neighborhoods.\n\nWe appreciate so much the vote of confidence in the partnership with Mayor Harrell's proposed ordinance reflects.\n\nAt the same time, discretionary decisions to divert people to community -based services must always be scrutinized to ensure that we aren't inadvertently compounding racial disparity with the choices of who to divert and the quality of care provided.\n\nWe're really pleased to see that the proposed ordinance requires regular data.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou can follow up with your written comments.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nWe've got Latonya Sevier.\n\nAnd after Latonya Sevier, I'm just noting that we have a former elected official in the room and I'd like to observe the courtesy of having representative Don Mason follow Latonya Sevier.\n\nLatonya, I'm so sorry.\n\nThank you.\n\nMy name is Latonya and I'm a black non -binary renter in D2.\n\nI'm here to ask again, I'm here again, telling you all again to reject this new criminal, change to the criminal code to prosecute drug possessions and public drug use.\n\nLet's visit San Francisco to see how their war on drugs is going.\n\nIn San Francisco, overdose deaths decreased in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThen they got a new district attorney who vowed to take a law and order approach to the opioid overdose epidemic, just like Seattle City Attorney Ann Davison and Council Member Sarah Nelson and Alex Peterson.\n\nSan Francisco's new war on drugs is going very badly.\n\nIn December of 2022, the San Francisco District Attorney shut down a critical day shelter and service provider in the Tenderloin.\n\nAt the end of May, the city launched an initiative to arrest people suspected of using drugs in public.\n\nThe result, drug -related deaths have surged by 41%.\n\nA third of the overdose victims were black, despite black people making up only 5 % of the city's population.\n\nVote now.\n\nWoo!\n\nWoo!\n\nWoo!\n\nWoo!\n\nFollowing Dawn Mason, we'll have Austin Haynes.\n\nGood morning, and thank you, Council Member Herbold, for having this hearing.\n\nAnd my name is Dawn Mason.\n\nI'm a former state representative.\n\nI represented the 37th District, and I'm here to speak about the children and to shame you as a council.\n\nIn all of your amendments, in all of your decision -making and problem -solving, you never considered the children.\n\nYou have allowed this city to surround our children who are going to school every day with illicit drugs, fencing.\n\nI'm speaking right now.\n\nI spent time over here at 12th and King Street.\n\nWe have a high school there.\n\nAnd what you have done is normed the worst, most egregious behavior a child can see.\n\nI'm asking you to be a hero today.\n\nBe a hero for the children.\n\nGo back to the drawing board and draw into this legislation drug -free zones.\n\nThere's a social construct that make people think that we already have drug -free zones, but we do not.\n\nIt's not the law.\n\nMake it the law that no one will consume a new drug against them like a drug in front of our children.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOur next speaker is Austin Haynes, and Austin will be followed by Deontay Dampers.\n\nHello, I took time off work here in downtown Seattle to testify.\n\nI'm a District 2 resident and homeowner.\n\nMy wife and I are expecting our first child.\n\nWe have lived the results of defunding the police and giving addicts, criminals, and homeless folks the ability to ruin a great city.\n\nWe have witnessed a murder a few hundred feet from our front door when we lived at the residences above Target.\n\nWe're scared to live here.\n\nMy wife and I have, oh, no.\n\nThis morning on a city of Seattle Street, we found the fuel tank of my wife's car drilled.\n\nThis $1 ,000 plus expense we can absorb.\n\nSome of my neighbors cannot, which means if it happened to them, they could slide into homelessness, adding to the doom loop.\n\nMy wife and I have options, and we may leave unless we see substantial progress on crime, homelessness, and open -air drug use.\n\nWe also both vote on every ballot.\n\nI'm in favor of this legislation.\n\nI implore every one of you to have a few conversations with folks who have experienced addiction and have now been clean and sober for a couple years, and ask them if they feel the laissez -faire attitude towards dealing with addiction is the right path.\n\nI've spoken with hundreds.\n\nI am certain you will hear a resounding no.\n\nThank you.\n\nGo ahead and leave.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Deontay Damper, followed by Sean Blackwell.\n\nGood morning, council.\n\nToday, I come in peace.\n\nUsually, I am ready to go at you about the war on drugs tactics.\n\nUsually, I'm really just saying how problematic you can be, but I think today we can be able to meet somewhere in the middle.\n\nThere's 27 million that's coming out of here that I hope that you can be able to provide, to not only invest into some of these programs that are out here, such as REACH and COLEAD, that are out here in the community.\n\nI think that as council members, as opposed to listening to these negative comments of stigmatizing our community members that are impacted by drugs, that you can also go out here and meet the people that are impacted, because a lot of them are unhoused by money that was promised from county and city council.\n\nI just hope that at this point of time, we can be able to meet each other in the middle.\n\nAnd that's all the hell I got for y 'all today.\n\nThank you.\n\nNext speaker is Sean Blackwell.\n\nAfter Sean Blackwell, we've got Barb Wilson.\n\nHey, good morning, council.\n\nI project manage and lead in East Precinct Cap Hill, downtown, also project managed Third Avenue project.\n\nI hear from desperate owners, operators, and businesses every day imploring us to reduce public safety issues in the community.\n\nMy entire focus is on increasing public safety for the entire community, hopefully in an upstream proactive way.\n\nWhen LEAD has enough case management and housing resources, we're able to effectively intervene.\n\nWe're able to increase public safety and we're able to, and the community feels that.\n\nWe within LEAD are absolutely committed to fulfilling the council's ordinance and fulfilling the vision in a really effective way.\n\nAnd we commend the mayor for creating a framework for diversion that has a lot of potential to be the most progressive and highly impactful ordinance in the country.\n\nWe also greatly appreciate the amendment of council members Mosqueda and Herbal.\n\nAnd I'll finish, I'll end with that, thanks.\n\nOur next speaker is Barb Wilson and Barb will be followed by Lars Erickson.\n\nHi, my name's Barb Wilson.\n\nI lead local government affairs for Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft believes major employers have an important role addressing these important issues for our community.\n\nAnd through partnership, philanthropy, and policy, we've worked closely with our communities across the region to support strong, vibrant, safe neighborhoods.\n\nWe urge you today to vote in favor of this legislation and we agree with this balance between law enforcement and treatment.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Lars Erickson and Lars will be followed by Adrian Meag perhaps, Lars.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMy name is Lars Erickson and I'm here providing testimony on behalf of the 2 ,500 members of the Seattle Metro Chamber and the Downtown Seattle Association.\n\nToday, as we have since May, we are urging the council to adopt an ordinance aligning local law with recently passed state legislation regarding drug use and possession to address the crisis and harm caused by fentanyl and other illegal drugs in our community.\n\nAnd we agree with the intent of legislation under consideration today.\n\nHelp people get treatment and enforce the law.\n\nAs you deliberate and discuss, we also hope that the final legislation passed today will be simple and effective.\n\nAnd we expect the practical, real -world application of the law to make good on the intent.\n\nPassage of legislation today is one step.\n\nThe measures of success will be that in the coming months, we will see more people in treatment, fewer people on the streets, and far fewer overdoses.\n\nWe urge you to keep those tangible outcomes in mind as you deliberate today.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Adrian, I believe it's Meek?\n\nMeese, thank you so much.\n\nFollowed by Reverend Harriet Walden.\n\nOkay.\n\nHi, my name is Adrian Meese and I am the founder and CEO of Fentanyl Awareness.\n\nAnd our mission is to educate the communities on the dangers of fentanyl and drug overdose through our events, our events books, and outreach programs that we pursue today.\n\nBe that I lost 11 people, I'm trying to make a change in the community and put a stop to the end of fentanyl and drug use and drug overdose.\n\nAnd I want to make a change by rehab programs and facilities like that, man, because it can happen to your mother, it can happen to your father, your sister, your brother, everybody's vulnerable to the dangers of fentanyl and drug overdose.\n\nSo help us stop this problem today, you know?\n\nHelp us stop this problem because if we can't, I mean, if we don't do it, then who will?\n\nAnd that's all I'm gonna say.\n\nThank y 'all.\n\nFentanyl Awareness.\n\nAll right.\n\nOur next speaker is Reverend Harriet Walden followed by Brent Haberman.\n\nGood morning.\n\nThank you, I'm Reverend Walden speaking for Mother's Police Accountability Day.\n\nAnd personally, I had a fentanyl exposure, almost died.\n\nI was ashamed to talk about it when I was here before.\n\nI'm 77 years old and never been involved with drugs.\n\nI think we have a real problem in Seattle and I think it's time to do what's hard.\n\nSometimes we have to do what's hard.\n\nAnd I mean, there was nothing wrong with the state law.\n\nI mean, the state ordinance, the state law was, I mean, it's not the war on drugs.\n\nWar on drugs was a felony and people see it's a felony.\n\nThere's a major difference between a felony and a gross misdemeanor.\n\nAnd I think people don't understand the difference between those two.\n\nSo I guess this will be a start, but it's not what it could be.\n\nIt's time for Seattle to really want to do what's hard.\n\nI mean, sometimes you have to have, I mean, if you raise children, and especially boys, you have to have some place where you're willing to do what's hard.\n\nAnd I think that mothers would stand behind the city council doing what's hard.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Brent Haberman, followed by Sam Wolf.\n\nHello, council.\n\nBrent Haberman here.\n\nI live at 9th and Virginia, and I've been a Seattle resident since 1986.\n\nI'm here today to support this measure, CB 12645, for many reasons with the short time period.\n\nI'll just give you a couple examples as to why.\n\nFirst of all, I have seen the degradation of our streets in the last four or five years to become such a serious issue because of the drug dealers on the street, open air and able to sell, as well as the drug users that are harming themselves.\n\nSo we're not taking care of anybody, actually.\n\nAnd so this bill should hopefully help that situation because people don't want to live here, want to move away.\n\nYou're losing a tax base because of the business to help everyone else.\n\nBelieve in stigmatizing anybody.\n\nI don't believe in discriminating against anybody, but I believe in safety in this city, and that's your major responsibility.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nNext, we have Sam Wolf, and then we're gonna move to some of our virtual speakers.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMy name is Sam Wolf.\n\nI'm a senior project manager for the LEAD program.\n\nI coordinate LEAD diversion services and case conferencing in North Seattle, and I have the honor of working with community leaders in the CID and Little Saigon to design street -based interventions for drug -related crime in their neighborhood.\n\nPDA appreciates the mayor's approach to this ordinance, which emphasizes diversion to care.\n\nThat is a clear advance beyond the state legislation.\n\nWe also deeply appreciate the substitute by Herbold and Lewis that would establish a standing behavioral health advisory committee.\n\nOur community has some of the most committed and advanced practitioners of modern recovery in the nation.\n\nTheir insights often don't make it into policy conversations.\n\nThe Lewis and Herbold proposal means that we would have the chance to tighten up our diversion and care systems, which is much needed if we're going to improve conditions on our streets and outcomes for the people that we're working with.\n\nThe mayor's fentanyl task force is convening this fall and will be a good start, but we're glad to see the proposal to make community input and expertise permanently available to public policy.\n\nThank you.\n\nActually, I'm going to take a few more people in person while I'm pulling up the online sign -up sheet.\n\nNext, we have Collin Lamb, and Collin will be followed by Jacob Michalak.\n\nMy name is Collin Lamb.\n\nI am a case manager with the Downtown Emergency Service Center, and I'm here to urge you all to vote against this measure because this directly targets the clients that I work with every day.\n\nAnd look, I know that nobody wants to see, you know, somebody sparking up on the bus or something.\n\nI have seen that myself, but I also understand that the people who use the bus to get to the bus stop and use these drugs are not the problem.\n\nIt is a lack of support.\n\nIt is a lack of harm -reduction programs that are...\n\nSorry, my throat's a little messed up.\n\nBut, you know, we need to fund harm -reduction and housing -first -based approaches to this problem.\n\nOtherwise, it's not going to go away.\n\nA new war on drugs is not going to fix it.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd, yeah, just vote against this bill, please.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker after Jacob Michalak is Kate Rubin.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMy name is Jacob Michalak, and I've been a homeowner in the Central District for the past 32 years.\n\nThank you very much for this opportunity to speak to you.\n\nMy entire career has been focused on housing and services for people living within the city.\n\nI've been involved in the fight against HIV and experiencing homelessness.\n\nI was the lead author of the first comprehensive plan to end homelessness in King County.\n\nAnd more recently, a suite of resources developed for the US Department of Housing and Urban Development titled Homecoming, Life After Incarceration.\n\nTime and again over the past 40 years, efforts by local, state, and federal governments to solve substance use issues through criminalization and enhanced policing have failed.\n\nAnd these policies have disproportionately impacted people of color, especially those with African -American heritage.\n\nThe proven solutions, as my colleagues are stating, center around sincere, robust investments in person -centered care, housing, employment, education, food security, and family stability.\n\nAll of our money should be going there.\n\nI am opposed to CB120645.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Kate Rubin, and Kate will be followed by Dennis Sills.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMy name is Kate Rubin.\n\nI live in the city of Seattle.\n\nI'm calling today to urge you to vote no on the racist and deadly Council Bill 120645 that criminalizes simple drug possession and drug use.\n\nThis regressive measure takes us right back to the failed war on drugs harming public health and targeting marginalized communities.\n\nStable housing is a prerequisite for effective substance abuse treatment.\n\nHousing First is the evidence -based, most effective approach to ending homelessness, backed by multiple national studies.\n\nWe are heading into budget season, and we are in a budget deficit.\n\nInstead of addressing the fentanyl crisis at its roots, investing in Housing First, this bill will drain our limited city resources, disproportionately harm our black, brown, and indigenous and unhoused neighbors, and overcrowd our already unhealthy jails.\n\nIt's rooted in white supremacy culture.\n\nDo the right thing and vote no on Council Bill 120645.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Dennis Sills, and Dennis will be followed by Michael Malini.\n\nChair Herbold and committee members, thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment.\n\nMy name is Dennis Sills, and I work at Plymouth Housing, a PSH provider to more than 1 ,200 chronically homeless adults in Seattle.\n\nPlymouth is a Housing First provider, which means we seek to meet residents where they are when they enter our housing.\n\nWe practice harm reduction strategies with achieving housing stability.\n\nWe are partnering with the city on a contingency management program to encourage recovery.\n\nWe support the amendments introduced today by Council Member Herbold and Lewis, and Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nPlymouth is committed to ending homelessness, and decades of experience shows support for those with substance use disorder can lead to housing stability.\n\nWe also know that justice system involvement can contribute to housing instability, so we appreciate that the council is considering alternatives like LEAD.\n\nWe also recognize that there must be an avenue to direct individuals to treatment when they are a threat to others, and when they will not enter treatment voluntarily.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Michael Malini, followed by Carissa Knight.\n\nHello, my name is Michael Malini.\n\nI'm a resident in District 3, and I'm calling to ask you to, again, reject the proposed legislation that would expand the city's criminal code to prosecute drug possession and public drug use.\n\nWe have decades of evidence that incarceration doesn't prevent overdose, nor give people the help they need.\n\nAny adoption of this law would increase overdoses, deaths, and racial disparities in arrest, jail time, and overdoses.\n\nThe proposed bill will bring us back to regressive and racist policies instead of moving toward evidence -based, effective, and more compassionate approaches.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOur next speaker is Carissa Knight.\n\nCarissa will be followed by Jason Walsh.\n\nHi, can you hear me?\n\nYes, we can.\n\nGreat, hi, I'm Carissa.\n\nI live in District 4, and I want improved public safety for everyone, and so I oppose this new war on drugs legislation.\n\nThrough regular volunteer mutual aid work, I've met several community members, some of whom use drugs, including someone who shared how much shame they felt about it, how it's so hard and painful to quit, and that sometimes that's what gets you through a day of dehumanization and stress.\n\nAnother person said that she did mess to stay up all night because she was so scared of people coming into her tent.\n\nAnd what I want for them is safety, professional care, resource community support, safe housing, and not a policy that could be even more deadly than the drug use itself.\n\nI'm curious why criminalization is our answer when it seems to defy expert recommendations to prioritize a public health approach with prevention and early intervention rather than punitive measures.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Jason Walsh, and Jason will be followed by Brandy Flood.\n\nGood morning.\n\nMy name is Jason.\n\nI'm a resident of B2, and I'm here to call on council to unequivocally say no to CB -120645, this new war on drugs.\n\nWhile I was a master's in public health student at the University of Washington, I worked with Snohomish Health District to develop a substance use disorder treatment matrix.\n\nThe county wanted to improve connectivity of health services and get people into treatment, not into cells.\n\nI learned that substance use disorder grew out of poverty.\n\nIt grew out of pain.\n\nIt grew out of trauma.\n\nI learned that as we decrease healthcare options and conversely increase the penalties for use when you choose to criminalize substance use, this perpetuates poverty.\n\nIt increases stigma.\n\nIt increases trauma.\n\nIt increases harm, which can lead to increased substance use.\n\nCriminalization doesn't break the cycle.\n\nIt perpetuates it.\n\nSo what is your real charge here as a council member?\n\nWhat is your mission?\n\nIs it to serve others or is it to sentence them?\n\nSubstance use disorder is an illness, and we treat illness with healthcare, not handcuffs.\n\nNo to a new war on drugs.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Brandy Flood, and Brandy will be followed by Catherine Stanford.\n\nThank you, Council Member Herbold.\n\nMy name is Brandy Flood.\n\nI'm a resident of the Rainier Beach neighborhood, and a homeowner.\n\nI'm also Director of Community Justice for the REACH Program, and I manage the contracts for LEAD, and I work with LEAD, Co -LEAD to work in this population.\n\nMy case managers serve folks that are being diverted to care.\n\nI agree with Reverend Walden.\n\nThis is not the war on drugs.\n\nThis is something different.\n\nThis is their version to care, and I appreciate the mayor's approach.\n\nIn order for this to actually work, there has to be sufficient resources to divert people to, which is why I appreciate Council Member Herbold and Louis's Behavioral Health Task Force and the Fentanyl Task Force that is coming up.\n\nMy staff and I walk the streets of downtown all the time.\n\nThey're riddled with black and brown people struggling from drug use that need to be connected to services, but we don't have adequate services to connect people to.\n\nSo I urge the council, if they're gonna push this for adequate resources to connect people to adequate treatment, housing, shelter, mental health, better crisis services.\n\nIf I had somebody in my office right now who needed to be in treatment or crisis, it would almost take me too much to get them in because there's so many systematic barriers to doing that.\n\nIt shouldn't be that way.\n\nWhen people need and ask for help, we should be able to do it immediately.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Catherine Stanford, and Catherine will be followed by Brian Cannon.\n\nHi, and thank you to Herbold and committee members for the opportunity to speak.\n\nAnd speaking on behalf of the building owners and managers of Seattle King County, BOMA, I also would like to note that personally, I have been engaged in downtown Seattle, both at the market and with my own business for over 30 years.\n\nAnd BOMA has been significantly engaged in public safety issues since before the pandemic.\n\nIt is critical to vote this bill out of committee and onto the full council.\n\nThe delay has cost us in human suffering and continued issues with open air drug dealing on our streets.\n\nA commercial real estate industry has been working hard to help revitalize downtown.\n\nPublic drug use is one barrier to attracting tenants, leaving us with less foot traffic and more empty storefronts downtown.\n\nIt's sort of this endless cycle.\n\nWe support the fact that BOMA will include measures to provide services and treatment options and diversion programs.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOur next speaker speaking remotely is Brian Cannon and Brian will be followed by Nicholas Jeffries.\n\nHi, my name is Brian Cannon.\n\nI oversee the community safety and hospitality ambassador program for the Metropolitan Improvement District.\n\nMy comments today are in support of the ordinance.\n\nAs we've seen, the fentanyl crisis has continued to worsen and cause harm to individuals and the community.\n\nOver the past year, our ambassador teams have administered Narcan to people over 180 times.\n\nAnd in the past week alone, they've administered it seven times.\n\nOne key component of this ordinance is the focus on diversion.\n\nI also believe that this is an opportunity to increase resources for existing programs such as LEAD and CoLEAD.\n\nMy team has worked with LEAD for the past decade and we've seen the LEAD program have a high level of success by providing stability for many people who've suffered with addiction and behavioral health issues.\n\nTheir approach has become a national model.\n\nUnfortunately, the program is at capacity and currently has to turn away many candidates who would be a good fit.\n\nI ask you to pass the ordinance and to provide resources needed to scale the LEAD program to meet the increased demand for diversion and services.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Nicholas Jeffries.\n\nAnd Nicholas will be followed by Randy Green.\n\nHey, how are you doing today?\n\nMy name is Nicholas Jeffries and I currently work with vacating and expunging criminal records.\n\nAnd I vote to vote no on this legislation because the money spent implementing this program can be used to create upstream solutions versus looking at the downstream impacts.\n\nIt's time to start funding programs that actually help people get into housing, help people access resources and help people manifest their greatest self.\n\nFrom firsthand experience, I could see the criminalization of drug usage, more specifically, giving people gross misdemeanors, really helps put, it puts barriers in place of getting help, it puts barriers in place of accessing employment.\n\nAnd as we know, with the rent hike and how much everything costs in Washington, if you don't have stable employment and don't make a livable wage, we're continuing to perpetuate this vicious, vicious cycle.\n\nAnd I think it's time for the community that we've worked together to help everybody in this city, to help everybody in this county manifest their greatest self.\n\nThank you for letting me speak.\n\nHave an amazing day.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Randy Green.\n\nRandy is showing it's not present right now.\n\nSo we'll move down to Matthew Offenbacher.\n\nAnd Matthew will be followed by Isabel Nguyen.\n\nHi, council.\n\nMy name is Matthew Offenbacher.\n\nI'm a homeowner in district three and a small business owner in district one.\n\nAnd I really can't believe that we're here again just a few months after you heard hours upon hours of testimony about the harm this legislation will cause.\n\nAdding drug possession and public drug use to our criminal code will be an ineffectual, racist, expensive, and deadly response to a horrifying public health crisis.\n\nNow, I can hear some of you thinking, but this bill is different.\n\nIt's all about harm reduction and diversion and case management.\n\nIt even says somewhere in there that the war on drugs was very, very bad for black people.\n\nWe are not fooled and don't fool yourselves.\n\nThis is a bad legislation.\n\nSo much of it is hand -waving promises and magical thinking.\n\nJust trust us.\n\nWhile at the actionable heart of it, it will permanently add to the city code a path for SPD to arrest and jail people with substance use disorders and for the city attorney to prosecute with the predictable effect of accelerating the already devastating loss of life the epidemic has caused.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Isabel Nguyen followed by Andrea Suarez.\n\nHello and good morning, council and the listening public.\n\nI live in D4 and I voted in D4 for the last 12 years.\n\nYou are set to vote again on amendments for CB 120645 that will increase incarceration and place vulnerable individuals under threat of incarceration, fines and police violence.\n\nYou are voting to have SPD a department that had the largest amount of sworn officers at the January 6th insurrection at our nation's Capitol.\n\nSix of our sworn officers were in DC attempting to tort our legal proceedings for the 2020 president of the United States.\n\nYou are saying that you want these same individuals and that same department to combat our drug crisis?\n\nThat same department where the VP of SPOG on a hot mic invalidating the significance of life, Giovanni Cadula, who was a grad student set to graduate with her master's in information systems was not worth more than, quote, 1 ,000 and a limited value, end quote.\n\nIf we have members of a department behind closed doors invalidating the life of a grad student, how much more do they invalidate the lives of those they're supposed to help and aid during these drug interactions?\n\nAre you voting to imbue and empower a department and more resources to murder Seattle residences?\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Andrea Suarez.\n\nAnd after Andrea speaks, we'll move back to in -person public commenters.\n\nGood morning.\n\nThis is Andrea Suarez, founder of We Heart Seattle.\n\nI have three years of practical experience, boots on the ground providing outreach and cleaning of encampments, removing a million pounds of debris, 20 ,000 dirty needles, and actually nine now passed bodies and hosting dozens of vigils.\n\nAnd I don't have a lot of numbers today or studies or committees, but only to urge the council to pass this ordinance to save lives now.\n\nNo more lives should pass because we're in this meeting.\n\nThe death toll is on all of our watches right now as we talk about this.\n\nI'm not here for political reasons or ideological reasons.\n\nI just want to save lives.\n\nIn Belltown, we had another shooting last night at an open air drug scene on 3rd and Blanchard where open air use of drugs are permitted.\n\nIf we would stop permitting that, we could reduce the loss of lives.\n\nAnd we need to stop treating people like hospice patients by barely keeping them alive through failed harm reduction efforts.\n\nWe need intervention outreach.\n\nYour next speaker is Teresa Lamb and Teresa will be followed by Julia Buck.\n\nThere are no facts to support that this will do anything but deeply harm marginalized communities.\n\nAnd you all know this.\n\nThere is no budget to support this and there is no plan, no care, compassion or commitment to do anything other than imprison our most vulnerable citizens.\n\nIf you really want to make positive changes in the city, stop pushing for inhumane laws like this and show the citizens, all citizens of Seattle that you are looking for real solutions, not pandering to businesses and election cycles.\n\nWork with the organizations that know what the needs are and know these vulnerable communities instead of putting your efforts into gaslighting everyone and passing something that you know will cost lives.\n\nIf you do support this inhumane law, don't pretend to support the efforts of these organizations that are honestly working to end homelessness and working with people with substance use disorder.\n\nYou can't support this law and claim to support these compassionate efforts at the same time.\n\nOur next speaker is Julia Buck and Julia will be followed by Peter Condit.\n\nGood morning, council.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak.\n\nI am here because I am not in favor of the bill currently under consideration.\n\nAnd I wanted to just briefly place it in a bit of a larger context because similar bills are happening all over the country in all 50 states, the red state of Texas and the blue state of Washington are having special sessions about the need to increase criminalization.\n\nAnd I think that there is an economic purpose to that.\n\nThe market of consumer goods made from prison labor is $11 billion.\n\nAnd I think that there is the opportunity to re -industrialize this country using involuntary labor because American workers are very expensive, which is a result of American health care being expensive.\n\nI would like to encourage you not to pursue this economic policy.\n\nThank you.\n\nGoodbye.\n\nOur next speaker is Peter Condit and Peter will be followed by Reza Arashi.\n\nHello, council members.\n\nMy name is Peter Condit and I live in district six.\n\nI ask that council reject the new war on drugs bill.\n\nDo y 'all know how to identify structural racism?\n\nDespite lavish use of the word diversion, the bill would create a new law that can be enforced.\n\nAnd despite purported good intentions, the war on drugs and SPD in particular have a record of racist and deadly outcomes.\n\nThat's structural racism.\n\nIf you need more, just yesterday, we heard a police conversation that took place after an SPD officer killed Janavi Kandula while speeding to an overdose.\n\nDetective auditor was laughing at Janavi's death.\n\nSPD is full of harmful people who prioritize their oversized paychecks over the very lives of Seattleites.\n\nStop involving cops in public health.\n\nStop giving them money and power.\n\nCouncil members, if you're discouraged by that recording, stand against this legislation.\n\nBe a force for good instead of supporting this malicious bill.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Reza Marashi, followed by Joy Abbott.\n\nHello, council members.\n\nMy name is Reza Marashi.\n\nI'm director of government affairs for Kilroy Realty Corporation and board chair of the Metropolitan Improvement District.\n\nI'm here to urge you to vote in favor of this council bill, a critical public safety measure for the city of Seattle.\n\nMy request to you today is to ask you The bill currently reflects the strong majority opinion of Seattleites.\n\nWe know from multiple rounds of public opinion polling that over 80 % of Seattle voters believe that restoring a safe and welcoming environment downtown will bring back residents, workers, and visitors and create the momentum needed to put downtown on a sustained path to recovery.\n\nSince August of 2022, the MID program has administered Narcan to 191 people.\n\nJuly 2023 has been our highest month so far with Narcan being administered to 25 people.\n\nSadly, the crisis is only getting worse.\n\nThat's why I believe this legislation is a critical step in addressing these issues by providing much needed resources for treatment and diversion programs.\n\nTo that end, please make sure that community -based resources that have demonstrated success are renewed and expanded.\n\nThose programs include Third Avenue Project, LEAD, and CoLEAD.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd I would just like to say that these chambers are a place for the democratic process to work for everyone.\n\nSo please, your comments are for public comment.\n\nI do not want any disruption of speakers because that hurts the ability of all of us to participate in this process.\n\nOur next speaker is Jay Abbott and Jay will be followed by Susie Morris.\n\nDo we have a Joy Abbott or a Jay Abbott?\n\nIf we do not, a Jay or a Joy Abbott and in the topic, I'm sorry.\n\nI'm Susie Morris.\n\nOkay, somebody who wanted to address issues about I'm assuming public safety and the ID.\n\nNot seeing anybody.\n\nShe's not here.\n\nGo ahead, Susie.\n\nShe had to leave.\n\nThank you.\n\nHi, I'm Susie Morris.\n\nI am a resident of District Two and I've lived in Mount Baker neighborhood for 25 years.\n\nI am also an EVP for Lowe Enterprises, which is a housing developer in the Seattle area.\n\nWe have a 550 unit project in Yesler Terrace that was recently built and we are under lease up right now.\n\nWe have, of that project, 26 and a half percent is affordable and the rest is market rate.\n\nYesler Terrace is a great example of what the city is doing to provide housing, but it's getting really hard with crime that's happening in Little Saigon.\n\nThere's been such a, you know, there was such a great effort by the police department.\n\nLots of things cleaned up and then it went away again.\n\nIt's really bad and we're losing residents.\n\nPeople are afraid to move in.\n\nPeople are moving out and something needs to change.\n\nI'm in support of this movement.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Ann Lyons and Ann will be followed by Mary Ann Christie.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak.\n\nI'm a retired teacher and I'm here as a mother.\n\nI have three friends who have lost children to drug overdose.\n\nOur state leads the nation in increase in overdose fatalities.\n\nI urge the council to act.\n\nI think we all want the same thing here, which is for people to be able to pursue a happy and healthy life, but what we're doing now is not working.\n\nAnd I support the bill.\n\nI know it's imperfect, but we need change.\n\nI've lived in this city for almost 30 years and I'm really worried about what is happening in our community and I just am begging you to act.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Mary Ann Christie.\n\nMy name's Mary Ann Christie.\n\nI live downtown and I'm here to support this public safety ordinance.\n\nAs a resident of downtown, I'm deeply concerned about public safety issues.\n\nI walk by and through drug markets every day.\n\nI'm away from my house to the drug store, which has got everything behind bars and locked up because of so much theft and the danger of just being working in that place.\n\nI think this legislation is a critical step in addressing issues by providing much needed resources for treatment and diversion programs.\n\nI want to make sure also that the council supports community -based resources that have demonstrated success and those programs include the Third Avenue Project, LEAD and CoLEAD.\n\nSo I urge you to vote in favor of this legislation, which will make our city a safer and healthier place for everyone.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nMoving back to virtual public comment, we'll hear next from Ramon Hernandez followed by Nick Jeffries.\n\nGood morning, council members.\n\nMy name is Ramon Hernandez.\n\nI work for LEAD.\n\nI am a South Precinct Project Manager working with community members, business organizations to resolve public safety issues.\n\nWe're excited about the mayor's and the council members' efforts to continue to guarantee information gathered on racial disparities and arrest, booking, prosecution.\n\nThe only way to guarantee that people who have historically had harsher responses to drug -related problems are included and benefit from the greater use of diversion is to do this.\n\nThe drug use policy, possession policy has the potential to be one of the best policies in the nation, and it can only fulfill its promises if we allocate the sufficient funds for services to be provided for care for those who are diverted.\n\nLEAD diversion services, they're evidence -based, highly effective without sufficient funding to increase diversion programs such as this.\n\nThese encouraged statements to MP, they can only frustrate and disappoint the community members who are here today in response to some of the public safety issues that they're encountering.\n\nEnacting this legislation alone is not sufficient.\n\nWe must adapt as the drug supply.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker, Nick Jeffries, is showing as not present.\n\nIf that changes before we're done public comment, I will come back to Nick.\n\nSimilarly with Shavonna Gaylor, also showing as not present.\n\nWe'll go down to Liam Nold, and Liam will be followed by Cody Zalewski.\n\nHi, my name is Liam Nold, and I'm calling to urge you to vote no on this ordinance.\n\nYou already heard testimony regarding how forcing people into drug treatment without addressing the underlying conditions that let them there does not work and increases overdose deaths.\n\nBeyond this, it gives police increased discretion to harass and enact violence against BIPOC and unhoused people.\n\nWe know this bill will disproportionately be enforced against BIPOC people, so please reject this bill and instead invest in harm reduction that is not attached to the deadly criminal punishment system.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Cody Zalewski, and Cody will be followed by Chris McKay.\n\nHello, council.\n\nThis is Cody Zalewski, resident of District Four.\n\nRecriminalizing drugs will push the fentanyl crisis out of sight of the general public, but it won't save lives.\n\nI get that voters want to see you doing something, but this is sweeping the problem under the rug at the behest of right -wing talk show hosts who live on the East Side.\n\nYou know this, and I know you know this because we've both heard the same stories from the same people struggling with addiction on the OEIR task force.\n\nPlease don't make life worse for people already struggling with substance abuse after being a progressive leader on drug law in the past.\n\nVote no on passing this out of the committee.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Chris McKay, and Chris will be followed by Aiden Carroll.\n\nChris McKay?\n\nI see you're with us.\n\nDoes it look like you're on mute?\n\nCan you hit star six if you haven't already?\n\nStar six, please.\n\nThere you go.\n\nAll right, so we're going to go ahead and we'll give you one more try.\n\nChris, we might need to come back to you.\n\nWe'll give you one more try.\n\nWe're not hearing you.\n\nStar six.\n\nAll right, I'm going to take another.\n\nI'm hitting star.\n\nThere you go, there you go.\n\nWe got you.\n\nOh, good, sorry.\n\nI kept hitting it.\n\nSorry about that.\n\nGood morning, council.\n\nThanks for allowing me to testify.\n\nMy name's Chris McKay.\n\nI'm the executive director of the West Seattle Junction Association.\n\nFor the past year, we've seen escalating drug use in our small park called Junction Plaza Park.\n\nPretty much been taken over by a handful of men who hang out there, threaten people, and do drugs openly.\n\nI have seen them offer drugs to teens, yell at people, and vandalize the park.\n\nJust last Saturday, I saw a man in the bus stop smoking up.\n\nThere were families everywhere.\n\nAlso, the apartment complex next to it is occupied by seniors who literally call me regularly to tell me what they're seeing and to let me know that they're terrified to use the park.\n\nMerchants call me regularly to describe how open drug use has negatively affected their businesses in a variety of ways.\n\nI receive calls from residents as well who are still scared and threatened.\n\nIt's shocking to me that in an effort to support the percentage of struggling individuals, we hold the rest of the city hostage.\n\nI'm asking the council to support this legislation addressing this chronic issue, and more importantly, to support organizations such as Lead & Reach, who work closely with my organization to help people who are struggling and make our public spaces safer.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Aiden Carroll, and Aiden is showing is not present.\n\nSo our last virtual public commenter that is showing is present is BJ Last.\n\nI will, after returning to the in -person public commenters and finishing that list, I will go back and check to see if any of the folks who've signed up virtually, but are listed as not present are present.\n\nBut we'll hear from BJ Last next.\n\nAnd then going back to in -person, we've got Suzanne Kotz next up on deck.\n\nBJ.\n\nHi, my name is BJ Last.\n\nI'm a homeowner in Ballard, and I'm calling once again to ask you once again to reject CB120645, if there's absolutely no such thing as a gentle war on drugs.\n\nThis bill will kill people and destroy lives without actually having any impact on rates of substances.\n\nThis bill will not house a single person.\n\nThis bill will not get a single person to treatment.\n\nThis bill will not even get a single person to diversion because there's absolutely no funding for any of that in this bill.\n\nIf council members did want to increase funding for those items, they probably would have waited to do this bill until after budget, instead of trying to push it through now and then hope everyone has forgotten about these promises when budget comes up.\n\nFor council members, council members Peterson, Nelson, Strauss and Lewis are already talking about finding efficiencies and austerity in next year's budget.\n\nThat is not going to actually increase the funding that this bill will do, which we all know it will not.\n\nAnd also drug possession is illegal.\n\nIt has been for every single day in Seattle for decades.\n\nAny overdoses you've seen, anything that makes you feel unsafe in public, that has happened while drugs are illegal.\n\nThis is nothing new.\n\nThis is continuing the same status quo that has gotten to us where we are today.\n\nWhat this bill does is it just gives our Republican city attorney, Anne Davison, full discretion on who to go and prosecute.\n\nAnd we know who her office prosecutes.\n\nShe prosecutes BIPOC community members and poor community members at massively disproportionate rates.\n\nThank you.\n\nReturning to in -person public speakers, we've got Suzanne Kotz followed by Bradley Doche.\n\nMy name is Suzanne Kotz.\n\nI'm a longtime resident of Capitol Hill and my comments are in support of this public safety ordinance.\n\nI and many other people are deeply concerned about public safety in the city.\n\nPeople need to feel safe riding on transit without worrying about the air being tainted by harmful or not harmful amounts of drugs.\n\nPeople need to feel safe patronizing restaurants in Little Saigon, which no longer can operate because people are afraid to go to that neighborhood now.\n\nPeople need to be able to shop on 3rd Avenue and enter a store.\n\nBusinesses need to know that their customers can come into their stores without having to negotiate an open -air drug market.\n\nThere has to be some point of compromise between what residents and visitors to the center need and expect and what people who are in need, who are on the streets, obviously in great distress.\n\nSo I urge you not only to pass this, but to make sure that there is funding allocated at a meeting level for diversion and support.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Bradley Dosh and Bradley will be followed by Megan O 'Hara.\n\nHi, Seattle City Council members.\n\nMy name is Bradley Dosh.\n\nI'm a constituent of Seattle Council District 1.\n\nI'm urging you to again reject the proposed legislation that would expand the city's criminal code to prosecute drug possession.\n\nAt Ruth's Young Adult Shelter, I spoke with many young people struggling with drugs.\n\nThese people need care, support, and community, not more interactions with the police.\n\nThese folks are human beings just like you and me and deserve to be treated as such.\n\nInstead of focusing on band -aid solutions, we should attack the roots of these issues.\n\nAs others have already stated, these include, but are not limited to, housing and food security, healthcare, and education.\n\nThere is a multitude of evidence that incarceration does not prevent overdoses nor give people the help they need.\n\nIt makes me angry that the city is considering a law that would increase overdoses, deaths, and racial disparities in arrests, jail time, and overdoses.\n\nThis proposed bill will bring us back to racist war on drug policies.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Megan O 'Hara and Megan will be followed by Christina McCormick.\n\nMegan.\n\nHi, my name is Megan and I'm with the Solidarity Budget.\n\nGrowing up, I had an aunt, Lori, and I spent a lot of time with her because she and my mom used to run a local business together.\n\nUnfortunately, she became addicted to opioids after a surgery and eventually fentanyl became a primary drug.\n\nAnd I'll never forget the day that I was on the phone with my mom and she found her dead from an overdose.\n\nAnd I'm sharing this with you all because I want to ask the council, have you ever shared a home with somebody who's addicted to opioids, particularly fentanyl, or had a truly close relationship with somebody addicted to opioids?\n\nBecause the most painful part isn't just losing somebody, but it's watching the battle of trying to get clean.\n\nAnd I've learned so much since her death about what could have worked and professionals here will share with you evidence -based solutions and that's not my role.\n\nBut one thing that they know definitively does not work\n\nAnd one thing every family member of somebody addicted to fentanyl knows doesn't work is incarceration.\n\nAnd if you don't know up close the struggle of trying to get clean, you can't pass this legislation because you don't know what you're up against.\n\nThis legislation sentences someone else's family member to death.\n\nAnd it's too late for my aunt, but it isn't too late for somebody else's family.\n\nSo vote no, because we can't waste any resources on making this problem worse.\n\nThank you.\n\nNext speaker is Christina Mann followed by Aretha Basu.\n\nHello, I'm Chris from the South side of Seattle.\n\nI'm in three separate organizations that work directly with individuals, dealing with substance issues.\n\nAnd to be honest, I joined three different organizations.\n\nI know it sounds like a lot because I believe in the community coming together to create solutions that are backed by data.\n\nI believe in seeing the young people that are with me in these organizations come together and look at data to go about this different community policies and there are plenty of angry, angry young people here today because we're sick of our public officials not listening to data when they create policies.\n\nWe're sick of having to come to things like this to tell you directly, hey, this isn't gonna work because you don't have data to back it up.\n\nAnd so here we are again, doing this again, months later again, because you're still not listening to data to back up policies.\n\nYoung people are sick of it and we're here to take our future.\n\nWe're here organizing.\n\nWe're here to talk to you.\n\nWe're here to take your jobs.\n\nWe're running for office.\n\nWe're here.\n\nOur next speaker is Aretha Basu followed by Dominic Driscoll.\n\nGood morning, council members.\n\nAretha Basu, political director of Puget Sound SAGE and SAGE Leaders.\n\nOn behalf of my organization, I ask you to vote no on the bill before you today.\n\nThis bill creates another inroad to incarceration because involvement in the criminal legal system does not heal people, does not house people, nor does it address the root causes of substance use.\n\nI appreciate council members' efforts to place guardrails within the bill towards diversion and detailed language on SPD conduct.\n\nHowever, people's access to treatment and resources should not have to come through contact with police and the system in the first place.\n\nWhat scares me most about this bill is that it places an enormous amount of authority and discretion in the hands of SPD, a department we just spent the last three years saying that very discretion didn't belong in.\n\nI have the gray hairs to prove it.\n\nI'm not even 30.\n\nThis fear is exacerbated by the story just this morning where Officer Daniel Arter said that the life of Jehannavi Kandula, who was killed by SPD, had limited value and that the city should cut a check.\n\nIs this who we trust to divert people and connect them with resources instead of arrest them on day -to -day interactions?\n\nNo.\n\nVote no today.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Dominic Driscoll, and Dominic will be followed by Christopher Arellano.\n\nHello.\n\nFirst off, I would like to thank the housing developers for showing up today, the folks who created the housing crisis and thus are a major contributor to the public health crisis in Seattle that is drug use or overdoses in particular.\n\nI'm here today in particular to remind y 'all that this bill is going to backfire because when the stuff is banned in public, people do it in private and they are going to see a spike in overdoses that are untreated.\n\nWhen that happens, that increases the fatality rate in Seattle, and by the time that happens, it's going to be the time for the next election, and the people who are going to be blamed are the city council.\n\nI would advise you, if you want to keep your seat, to vote against this bill.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Christopher Arellano followed by Colin Scone.\n\nMy name is Chris Arellano.\n\nI'm a representative to UFCW members in Seattle and King County and a constituent of D6.\n\nCouncil members, we've been here before, not just in this room and on this bill, but in this war on drugs.\n\nSince the sixties, our government has taken a punitive approach towards drug use and addiction.\n\nIf punishing people for drug use works, why are we here 60 years later?\n\nPunishing people for addiction doesn't work, period.\n\nIf you want to see less suffering in our streets, you all should focus your time on the root causes of homelessness and addiction.\n\nDo something about the soaring price of housing and runaway inflation.\n\nThat would be a great place to start, and it would positively affect the constituents you deem clean or worthy as well.\n\nLouis, Strauss, if you're listening, do what we at UFCW 3000 endorsed you to do, which is the right thing for our members, for your constituents, for the people of Seattle.\n\nVote no.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Colin Scone, and Colin will be followed by Lisa Marcus.\n\nColin Scone.\n\nOkay, moving on to Lisa Marcus.\n\nWe have Lisa Marcus in the room.\n\nOkay, and then followed by, Lisa Marcus followed by Stephanie Tidholm.\n\nHi, I'm Lisa Marcus.\n\nI'm a constituent.\n\nI live in Green Lake for the last 25 years.\n\nI actually have a close family friend who died of a fentanyl overdose.\n\nIn his bed, in a Green Lake home.\n\nThis is not a problem of just some people.\n\nThis is a problem that needs addressing at a mental health level, at a societal support level.\n\nPeople need to have the resources to go and get help.\n\nIf it's stigmatized, if it's criminalized, people will die.\n\nThis is not a solution.\n\nAny money going toward solution needs to go toward the organizations which provide the support to housing, which gets people what they basic needs, not to criminalizing, not to the police.\n\nPlease, please vote no on this bill.\n\nOur next speaker is Stephanie Tidholm and Stephanie will be followed by Luca Howard.\n\nHello, my name is Stephanie Tidholm.\n\nI'm a longtime resident of District 1 as well as a case manager on the LEAD program.\n\nI wanna say that I do appreciate the efforts of the mayor and a few of our council members in enhancing some of the diversion services.\n\nBut I will say working previously as a substance abuse counselor, that the Housing First model is paramount.\n\nI know that the language is criminalizing drug use, but ultimately we're criminalizing homelessness and not having the allocation of resources to be able to house these people and sustainable housing at that and affordable housing is a huge issue.\n\nAnd if we don't do something to enhance the funding, not only for the LEAD and the REACH program, but all social services programs that are serving this population, we're going to continue these same cycles of people being on the streets.\n\nSo I would urge you to consider where these resources are being allocated and allocate the funds accordingly so that we can actually resolve this issue and not keep going in this crazy circle.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Luca Howard and Luca Howard will be followed by Renaissance.\n\nHello, I'm Luca Howard, a D5 resident and I'm here speaking against the drug war that everybody here is pursuing.\n\nI'm going to read you an excerpt.\n\nI think she went up on the hood, hit the windshield and then when he hit the brakes, she flew off the car, but she's dead.\n\nIt's a regular person.\n\nJust write a check for $11 ,000.\n\nShe was 26 anyway.\n\nShe had limited value.\n\nThis was the police reaction to them killing somebody.\n\nDo you really expect this police force to fairly and equitably enforce the legislation you propose, especially considering that nobody here has created enough police alternatives to actually support the bill in the way that you want them to?\n\nPlease vote no on this bill.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Renaissance.\n\nAnd this is, Renaissance is our last speaker signed up for public comment in person.\n\nMy name is Renaissance.\n\nI'm the co -director of campaigns at 350 Seattle.\n\nI'm also an organizer with Seattle Solidarity Budget and an organizer with Whose Streets? Our Streets.\n\nAnd today I brought a book because oftentimes it seems like we are blowing smoke at the council.\n\nAnd this book is called No More Police.\n\nIt was authored by Mariam Kaba and Andre Ritchie.\n\nAnd everything that has been discussed today about why to oppose this bill and this piece of legislation is contained in this book and many others.\n\nAnd something that I've heard over and over today in this council, inflammatory language around open air markets and a great author, Michelle Alexander, who authored The New Jim Crow, talked about the comparison between open air markets and closed house markets.\n\nAnd what we're actually discussing is the difference between who was selling and doing the drugs as opposed to just where the drugs are being sold at.\n\nAnd then over and over, we've heard about Daniel Honduras, the SPD officer who was talking about John V. Candula.\n\nAnd when he said her life had little value, he was talking about young BIPOC migrant folks and those are not the kinds of people that we can trust to enforce these kinds of laws.\n\nSo vote no on this legislation.\n\nThank you.\n\nThere's one more person who's signed up online and that is Reed Olson.\n\nReed, if you're with us, we can hear from you now.\n\nGo ahead.\n\nAlso, one more person.\n\nHello, can you hear me?\n\nGo ahead, Reed.\n\nThank you.\n\nWhere do I begin?\n\nYeah, this is my third time calling in to say no against this racist, classist, stupid, dangerous war on drugs, which is really just a way to brutalize homeless people.\n\nThis is about some people are uncomfortable seeing unhoused humans in the streets where they do business.\n\nAnd I'm upset about that too, but for different reasons.\n\nWe need a housing first model.\n\nWe needed it yesterday.\n\nPeople like Tobias from Real Change have done great reporting on how verbiage like open air drug markets allow for sensationalization, pro -clutching, and allows a certain set of people to wash their hands and consider our unhoused neighbors as humans.\n\nThis is not something that was written by caregivers.\n\nI work in healthcare.\n\nI work with many of the people you are trying to criminalize.\n\nI think it's dangerous.\n\nPlease find it in your hearts to vote no.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd we have a couple of folks still signing up for in -person public comment.\n\nSo we'll return to that.\n\nWe've got Aiden Carroll followed by Shannon Newsome.\n\nSo this bill is as wrong as it was in the spring.\n\nI appreciate, I guess, some of the attempts to increase diversion, but unless there's treatment to go to, it doesn't really mean anything.\n\nAnd as long as there is drugs being confiscated or people being arrested, that's going to increase overdoses.\n\nThe myth of refusing help is typically intertwined in these things.\n\nAnd the fact is that people want treatment, but the treatment system we have needs to be fixed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of insurance, in terms of Suboxone, in terms of the length of time before and after.\n\nAnd the outpatient treatment is real treatment and it's the kind that works best for people who are not going to be housed anytime soon.\n\nPlease keep all of that in mind and do not vote for something that is going to kill people.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next speaker is Shannon Newsome.\n\nThank you.\n\nHi, I'm Shannon Newsome.\n\nI am a constituent in Capitol Hill.\n\nI have grown up in the Seattle area in Bellevue and now in Seattle.\n\nI am a...\n\nProfessionally, I'm trained in social work.\n\nAnd personally, I'm a member of the peer recovery community.\n\nI know that in the 1700s, King George, at the time of the American Revolution, had a mental illness.\n\nAnd he got the most, the best treatments around, which were for his stuff, bipolar disorder, exposure to nature, time with a therapist, a consultation.\n\nAnd another person during this time was locked up for her mental illness and did not receive treatment.\n\nThe King George recovered from his pressing crisis.\n\nThe person that was locked up was not, she was in, she was criminalized for the rest of her life.\n\nAnd the recovery community, we have the knowledge that criminalization just doesn't work.\n\nThank you.\n\nCanon is our last in -person public speaker.\n\nReturning to the online speakers, none of the folks who were showing as not present are showing present.\n\nSo with that, we will conclude public comment and we will move into the single item on our agenda.\n\nWill the clerk please read in agenda item one.\n\nAgenda item one, council bill 120645.\n\nAn ordinance relating to controlled substances, adding the crimes of knowing possession of a controlled substance and use of a controlled substance in a public place.\n\nAmending section 128 .09 .020 of the Seattle Municipal Code and adding a new section 3 .28 .141 to the Seattle Municipal Code.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nI have some introductory remarks and my co -sponsor on this bill may have some as well.\n\nAnd then we'll work on hearing from central staff and getting the substitute in front of us and hearing some of the amendments.\n\nSo just as background, this committee hosted a briefing from the mayor's office on this bill back on August 14th.\n\nI wanna say publicly that I appreciate that the executive has taken a nuanced approach in its proposal to implement the authority granted by the state legislature, consistent with the role of the mayor as head of the executive branch of government.\n\nI appreciate the delineation within the bill of how the authority is intended to be used in practice when deciding whether to pursue a diversion or arrest and providing clear practical direction to officers on how to use the authority.\n\nI further appreciate the findings in the bill itself and the recitals stating for instance, that diversion is the preferred approach in the city of Seattle.\n\nUnlike the previous version of the bill, when we say diversion is the preferred approach in the city of Seattle, this includes what is called pre -arrest diversion that it will be used for many that this bill directs officers to use their discretion to not choose to arrest because they are not meeting the definition in the bill of committing harm to others.\n\nThen there's another kind of diversion that we refer to as pre -booking diversion that will be used and prioritized for others.\n\nThis is language that was neither in the state law nor was in the previous version of the bill.\n\nAnd it really, I think does a good job of implementing the mayor's approach of a desire to balance public safety objectives with the mayor's own experience with the war on drugs.\n\nWe know that a law enforcement only approach won't work, not only because of the limited number of officers and the limitations on jail capacity, but because enforcement only is not an approach that works for everyone.\n\nAnd we really need to work to get the resources that we have available for pre -arrest diversion and pre -booking diversion to assist people in living more productive and healthy lives.\n\nThe recitals also recognize that prior federal, state and local drug enforcement and policies, including the war on drugs has disproportionately impacted black, indigenous and people of color.\n\nAnd that causes trauma and pain that still linger in these communities today.\n\nAnd the bill states that the city of Seattle is committed to not repeating the errors of the past and will work to have the implementation, will have the implementation of this ordinance to balance public safety with the wellbeing of individuals using controlled substance.\n\nClearly stating that commitment to a balanced approach is vitally important.\n\nAgain, state law applies everywhere throughout the state.\n\nSo the state law making possession in public use gross to misdemeanors applies in Seattle, whether or not we act on this bill or not.\n\nThis bill, I believe does meet in the middle as we heard from some public testimony.\n\nI wanna give a little bit of a background on, excuse me, we cannot have any disruptions while the council is debating the bill.\n\nThe time for public comment is over.\n\nIn a August 14th committee meeting of this committee with a panel discussion with providers, such as LEAD, REACH, We Deliver Care on 3rd Avenue, the Public Defender Association and the Fire Department.\n\nWe heard from frontline workers to identify the gaps in diversion services.\n\nThis briefing made very clear to everyone on this committee that we have much work to do.\n\nKey points that were made were the importance of stability for people trying to access addiction and related issues, things like sleep, food and safety.\n\nThis ties into the lack of availability of housing and barriers to access housing and long -term care.\n\nWe Deliver Care, for example, reported that they can regularly get people into detox, but often there's nowhere for persons coming out of detox to go afterwards.\n\nAnother presenter in that committee meeting shared a story of a client who the court determined needed substance use treatment.\n\nThis person had high medical needs.\n\nTheir health was so compromised that there was no treatment facility in the entire state that would admit this individual.\n\nThis client had, again, very high medical needs and needed substance use treatment, had no options to get care.\n\nAnd what happened after this client sat in jail for four months was that the city prosecutor dismissed the case.\n\nAnd this individual was released to the street with no care, again, after sitting in jail for four months.\n\nRepresentatives for the Fire Department's Health One Division spoke to the difficult cycle of withdrawal from Frentenel and the importance of stability coming out of the mayor's April executive order.\n\nHealth One established a new specialized unit to respond to overdose calls.\n\nWe learned that between January and July 31st, 2023, first responders and bystanders have, on average, responded to 11 overdoses a day in a public place.\n\nAgain, that's 11 individuals who had their overdoses reversed, either successfully or not, each and every day between January and July 31st.\n\nAfter a successful overdose of a person living unsheltered, Health One saves a life and then has no other option but to leave the person whose life they've just saved exactly where they found them.\n\nThe panel spoke to the need for a post -overdose diversion facility where these frontline workers, these first responders, can bring people after a non -fatal overdose to recover, get stabilized on medications and access resources.\n\nIn my next committee meeting coming up in September, I believe it's the 26th, we will discuss the mayor's funding for this post -overdose recovery facility.\n\nI do appreciate working with co -sponsor Lewis and the mayor's office on both the underlying bill and the substitute that we'll be discussing today, but I'll hold comments on the substitute until we get to it and we'll turn it over to Council Member Lewis as co -sponsor to make introductory remarks.\n\nThank you so much, Chair Herbold.\n\nI'll be brief, given your comprehensive overview of the legislation.\n\nI do wanna thank at the front, Andrew Meyerberg, who's sitting in the gallery, who has really shepherded this policy process over the last several months, working closely with Mayor Harrell, and thank Mayor Harrell for his very direct and hands -on attention to this policy to really make sure that this issue, which I think everybody can agree is one of the biggest and most pressing issues in the city, is getting the attention that it deserves, is getting the focus that it deserves in how to have a practical on -the -ground policy to implement it, and that what we are really focusing on here is how to take full advantage of our provider community, the resources that they bring to the forefront to facilitate warm handoffs from law enforcement to providers, in many cases, as was mentioned in the public comment, to have providers just do the initial outreach without the involvement of law enforcement.\n\nThat is still compatible with the enforcement of this legislation.\n\nAnd to keep these public health crises to the greatest extent possible outside of the slow and ponderous criminal legal system where cases can drag on for months, for months, for years, where things can be dismissed without a person ever getting access to any kind of help or assistance, and to have a policy put in place that triages, prioritizes, and takes full advantage of a ecosystem that we have developed to an extent that is an international best practice, where law enforcement -assisted diversion will go around the world to give seminars on the work that we have done around harm -reduction -informed care to take full advantage of those systems to make sure that wellness and best practices in public health are the things that are highlighted in our approach, while also reserving the ability and the leeway and the discretion to hold people accountable in situations where that help and assistance is not always taken advantage of.\n\nThis legislation strikes that balance.\n\nIt'll be followed on by executive actions that complement it that we have been working on through Mayor Harrell's task force.\n\nIt'll be followed on by budget additions that have been foreshadowed and that will be part of our budget discussions this fall.\n\nAnd with that, I think I'll hand it back over to you, Chair Herbold, and thank you for your leadership in really helping to marshal the council's resources to produce this legislative product and look forward to discussing amendments from colleagues and the underlying legislation.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAnd so to procedurally allow us to begin to discuss the amendments, we do need to move the underlying bill.\n\nI intend to do so and ask for a second.\n\nAnd then after that, I will do the same for the substitute, but I will also ask that Council Central staff help walk us through that substitute.\n\nSo Council Members, I move the committee recommends the passage of Council Bill 120645.\n\nIs there a second?\n\nSecond.\n\nThank you.\n\nCouncil Bill 120645 has been moved and seconded.\n\nWe can now move on to consideration of amendments.\n\nAgain, I will first ask for a motion, then after the motion and second, we'll ask Central staff to describe the amendment and ask the sponsor to add any comments they have to the amendment themselves.\n\nSo first up is Amendment 1, sponsored by myself and Council Member Lewis.\n\nThere is a revised version of this amendment that was shared this morning by email.\n\nIs there a motion?\n\nMove the substitute Amendment 1.\n\nThank you.\n\nIs there a second?\n\nI will second it.\n\nYou motioned, I will second it.\n\nSo the revised version of Substitute Amendment 1 is now before us and we can move forward with Council Central staff describing to us the changes in the substitute as compared to the introduced bill.\n\nOkay.\n\nGood morning, committee members.\n\nAsha Venkatraman of your Council Central staff.\n\nAs Council Member Herbold mentioned, there is a revised version of the substitute for your consideration.\n\nThere were just multiple technical updates that we made to this version two, but I'll go through this version two and describe each of the changes as they come up.\n\nAnd so first, as you'll see on the amendment, we added a recital.\n\nThat recital says, whereas while pre -booking diversion and community -based care are preferred, there may be unique articulable circumstances that are so acute or problematic that they make pre -booking diversion alternatives an ineffective response to the situation.\n\nThe second is a reference to the crimes covered in the state bill.\n\nIt adds a new subsection 3 .28141A.\n\nIt's mostly a technical change.\n\nIt's just so the short or abbreviated versions of what crimes are covered by this ordinance.\n\nSo things shorthand like possession of drugs or public use of a controlled substance, it creates just one reference to the crimes covered so that we can repeat that reference throughout the section.\n\nThe next would add a new subsection E3 to 3 .28141.\n\nAnd it makes clear that if diversion rather than arrest is the appropriate response to an individual, the lack of availability of diversion should not mean that an arrest should occur instead.\n\nSo the added language in there is a lack of diversion opportunities shall not be a reason for arrest.\n\nThe next change refers to the same policy in 3 .28141E that pre -booking diversion is preferred even when a person poses a threat of harm to others.\n\nThat addition goes in the threat of harm to others section.\n\nAnd it's intended to make clear that diversion is the preferred response regardless of the outcome of a threat of harm assessment.\n\nThe next item changes references to the threat of harm to others and threat of harm to self sections, just to be consistent in saying that a threat of harm assessment is not an element of the crime to be proved during prosecution.\n\nThe next item clarifies that in the threat of harm to self section, that if an individual is not determined to be a threat of harm to others, then they only pose a threat of harm to themselves.\n\nThe next change clarifies that officers are exempt from complying with the requirement that they make a reasonable attempt to contact and coordinate efforts towards diversion, outreach or other alternatives to arrest if the most appropriate or viable care strategy appears to be transport to a diversion point of contact, a medical care facility, a crisis care center or a diversion facility.\n\nThe next change specifies that officers may not arrest a person when they are only a harm to themselves without additional, excuse me, additional articulable facts and circumstances that would warrant arrest and details that SBD policies should identify what those additional facts and circumstances are.\n\nThe next change adds a new subsection that would ask SPD to try and use officers with 40 or more hours of crisis intervention team training to respond to these crimes where operationally possible.\n\nAnd then the next change adds a new section four and that section establishes a behavioral health advisory committee intended to advise the city about the needs for change in police protocols in this legislation or any other policies related to this legislation as well as an ask to provide data that is recommended for collection by the state substance use and recovery services plan biannually.\n\nNow, those are all the changes that were included in version one of this amendment.\n\nAs you'll have seen, as we've been scrolling throughout, there are highlighted changes and those are the changes that make up this version two.\n\nSo starting at the bottom here, you'll see there's an additional section five that lays out the authority for the city to create this legislation and lays out some express purposes for the legislation itself as well as some pieces about specific intent.\n\nMoving backwards from there, you will see highlighted this new section J and it makes clear that an officer's failure to comply with the sections around threat of harm or anything else in this legislation is not intended to be a basis to exclude or render evidence inadmissible.\n\nGoing back up from there, you'll see highlighted in subsection two there, a clarification of what reasonableness is when talking about the officer's discretion and just making clear that reasonableness is determined from the perspective of a reasonable officer facing similar circumstances.\n\nBut then going up from there, just a clarity added to subsection G, which is the threat of harm to others assessment, that the assessment itself will occur after probable cause has been established.\n\nSo just making sure that the timeline on that is clear.\n\nThis last piece is just including that nothing in the ordinance mandates that an arrest should occur.\n\nSo we're not taking away any of the officer's discretion to arrest if they choose to do so.\n\nThere's no requirements for arrest that are described in the legislation.\n\nI think that is all of the additional changes made to this version of the amendment.\n\nThank you so much, Asha.\n\nI just wanna also take a moment to thank Council Member Mosqueda and her staff for their work on this substitute.\n\nMuch of what we heard that Asha go through on the substitute were clarifying sections in a way that is consistent with the Mayor's proposal, the introduced version of the Mayor's proposal.\n\nBut there are some substantive additions.\n\nAnd I thank Council Member Mosqueda for some of those substantive additions, including the efforts to prioritize officers with 40 or more hours of crisis intervention team training, as well as the creation of the Behavioral Health Committee to advise the city on needs for changes in police protocol legislation or this particular policy after having an opportunity to see how the police policies and procedures are working on the ground and making sure that we have folks who have expertise in addressing the needs of individuals and have them in the driver's seat in making recommendations to policy.\n\nSo with that, do we have questions or comments about the substitute?\n\nJust looking both virtually for a virtual Council Member, as well as in person, not seeing any.\n\nYeah, up.\n\nOh, sorry, I do have a few comments.\n\nOh, there you are.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm not seeing your hand here.\n\nThat's okay.\n\nI'm gonna put a different screen up.\n\nAll right, there you go.\n\nGo for it.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nYou might've blended in with my background there.\n\nThank you, Madam Chair.\n\nAnd thank you for your comments as well about the work that our team has done.\n\nLed by Melanie Cray and the incredible work that she has done literally round the clock throughout the recess.\n\nUnfortunately, she spent many of her days and nights trying to do additional research on the legislation in front of us.\n\nSo I do appreciate the note of appreciation for her.\n\nMelanie Cray on our team and in partnership with Asha Vankantraman and Greg Goss and Lauren Henry and Ann Gorman and Jen Lebrek, all from central staff who similarly spent tireless hours over the break working on this.\n\nI just have a few comments on the substitute bill, Madam Chair, and much of the substitute bill, as you've noted, has been informed by conversation with the community.\n\nSo I'll just say thanks to those folks right now since the substitute will form the basis for the legislation that we'll consider here in a minute.\n\nSo thanks again to folks from LEAD and PDA, Lisa Dugard and Tara Moss for consulting with us along with Anita Condewall, Director of King County Department of Public Defense for her partnership and advocacy in reaching out and the folks at REACH, SEIU 925, DESC, King County Department of Community and Harm Services.\n\nAnd of course, the folks at the ACLU Washington for their help in thinking through some of the complex issues that we are trying to address in our city here and to build on the state legislation.\n\nCouncil Member Herbold, as chair of the committee, you have just been a incredibly accessible leader on this issue along with your staff member, Newell Aldridge.\n\nSo I wanna thank you and your team for your engagement with my team specifically, ongoing conversations with Melanie over the break on this bill.\n\nI do wanna express my support for the substitute bill.\n\nI really do appreciate the panel that you led with, Madam Chair, in our previous committee meeting.\n\nI believe that the substitute bill really leaned in heavily, as you noted, on trying to make sure that there is a array of community partners out there that want to have more services and want to have more resources to assist people and this legislation, I think, with the substitute makes it clear that arrests and charging should be an extreme last resort and not the first resort.\n\nOnly when a person cannot be deescalated by a lead to prevent booking and go into charging, I think that this makes a lot of good strides in making that clear.\n\nI'm glad to support this because I think that it makes clear that pre -booking diversion is a priority for people as we try to also reduce the harm to themselves or to others and pre -arrest diversion is a priority for people who pose a threat of harm only to themselves.\n\nSo I think that there's good clarification in here and it creates really solid data collection requirements.\n\nI will note my concerns with the underlying bill that are still embedded in the substitute, even though I am going to be supporting the substitute vote here at this point in the committee, it still involves police in what is a public health crisis, despite the decades of data that show us that police and arrests only exacerbate harm when we are trying to force them to serve in this role and force people into a system when they really need public health services.\n\nIt still allows for people to become entangled in the criminal legal system and it still perpetuates a system of beliefs that was debunked decades ago.\n\nI'm specifically concerned with the addition that we saw from yesterday's version that says, quote, an officer's failure to comply with subsections 328 .141G and 328 .141H or any other provisions of this legislation will not be a basis to exclude or render inadmissible any subsequently obtained evidence.\n\nMy concern is that this removes an important component of the substitute that we had previously seen.\n\nI think that it significantly disadvantages people who face criminal charges under the law.\n\nI am worried that it limits defendants potential defense if police don't follow the guardrails that we set out clearly in this legislation and they will end up in jail.\n\nAnd as we've seen from reports and headlines and public health data, sending people to jail only exacerbates the chances that they will have an overdose or they will die either in jail or when they come out of jail and begin consuming again.\n\nSo my concern is that the framework on this still allows for a system that is not backed by public health data and the guardrail language is good that we worked on.\n\nI think it makes it much clearer that diversion should always be the first approach.\n\nAnd I do hope that this is a signal of our support for arrest being the absolute last resort before booking and going to jail.\n\nSo I'll be a yes on this up today.\n\nAnd I thank the chair for including many of the amendment and policy ideas that our team and community had been suggesting.\n\nThank you, Madam Chair.\n\nYep.\n\nMuch appreciated.\n\nAny other?\n\nYes, Council Member Peterson.\n\nChair Herbold, can you talk more about the Behavioral Health Alternatives Committee?\n\nAnd is that something that would need to be permanent or is it something that we're after time it'll be clear what direction we're heading and it doesn't need to be in perpetuity and advisory committee?\n\nYeah, I think the thinking that I have expressed to the executive on this item is given that there is a fentanyl users task force that is made up of many of the same individuals that we would want to be monitoring the use of this ordinance, that it would make sense for the responsibility here to sort of morph into the work of the fentanyl users task force.\n\nThat's what's been discussed with the executive.\n\nWe've intentionally kept it loose because I think this is a piece that we still need to work out.\n\nThere was some consideration of much more formalized language about whether or not the council should appoint some members and the mayor should appoint whether or not we would be following our normal procedures for formal commissions.\n\nAnd I didn't think it was a good idea to go that route because there's still more to be discussed with the executive about the formation of that group.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nI'll look forward to that discussion.\n\nYeah.\n\nThanks.\n\nAny other comments on the substitute?\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nThank you.\n\nSo it took two years and a special session for the state legislature to come up with a Blake fix.\n\nAnd now we have a law, but the city of Seattle is about to break it by imposing several conditions that will restrict officer's ability to make arrests, even though they have probable cause.\n\nAnd that's tragic in itself because the drug crisis is the most crushing public safety, public health issue of our time right now.\n\nAnd let me replay, excuse me.\n\nWe need to hear from the council members on the dais.\n\nI cannot have disruptions to our process, our democratic process.\n\nPlease keep your comments contained and allow the council members to speak as I've recognized them.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThat's, let me repeat that past paragraph.\n\nThat's tragic in itself because the drug crisis we see playing out on our streets is the most crushing public health and safety issue of our time with Washington having the highest number of overdoses in the US and the vast majority occurring in Seattle.\n\nAnd restricting arrests means people will not be diverted into treatment, which is the goal.\n\nIt's the goal that we've been stating all along here and is still my fundamental goal.\n\nAnd I'm also very concerned about the legal risks presented by these proposed modifications to state law.\n\nOn in the August 14th special meeting, I expressed concern that requiring officers to assess a threat of harm to others, however that's defined, and we haven't seen the EO yet, the executive order, inserts officer discretion directly into the law and could open the city up to allegations of bias policing and or be used in a motion to dismiss by the defense.\n\nAnd since that meeting, none of the information that I've received, which has been extensive, has allayed those concerns.\n\nAnd this substitute, despite the changes that have been made that I've seen only this morning, only increases my concerns about legal risk because it adds a whole bunch of more conditions and complexity.\n\nAnd so that is why I put forward two amendments.\n\nHopefully we'll be able to talk about those after all the other amendments.\n\nBut I'm getting the sense that this is, that if we, that this is the passage of this substitute is sort of the deal breaker for the sponsors to vote on the whole bill.\n\nIs that the case?\n\nThis is the bill that Council Member Lewis and I are sponsoring.\n\nSo this is, and the substitute that is before us largely clarifies the intent that was in the underlying bill.\n\nAs I mentioned, there are only two substantive differences and that relates to the officers that are used for enforcing the law, having preferencing, prioritizing that they have CRT training and the committee.\n\nEverything else that you see before you in this substitute is a clarification of the original introduced bill proposed by the mayor and sponsored by Council Member Lewis and I.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis.\n\nYes, the thing that I would just clarify is I don't think the phrasing of whether this substitute is contingent for my vote is the proper phrasing.\n\nI would rather say the substitute is the result of a long and comprehensive collaborative process with Mayor Harrell and expresses Mayor Harrell's clear preferences in how to take this law into practice in the city of Seattle.\n\nSo I don't think the characterization comports with the collaboration that the council has had with the mayor's office over the last several weeks in putting this together.\n\nThis substitute is supported by the mayor's office and was extensively crafted in consultation with them.\n\nSo I just want to make that clear on the record.\n\nAnd again, thank Mayor Harrell for his leadership in promulgating these policies for our consideration.\n\nThank you.\n\nAny other comments or questions?\n\nI just don't, my question is should, are the additional amendments on here, are they amendments or additions to your, the language that you put forward in the substitute?\n\nI just don't know when to suggest that we consider the amendments that I distributed this morning.\n\nThe parliamentary procedure is after we vote on the substitute, then we will go through the amendments to the substitute.\n\nOkay, thank you very much.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSeeing no further questions or comments, Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll on the adoption of amendment one?\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nNay.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nYes.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nYes.\n\nFour yes, one no.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nThe motion carries and the amendment is adopted.\n\nWe can now move on to the next amendment.\n\nNext up is amendment number two, sponsored by Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nAgain, let's get it in front of us with a motion and a second, and then we'll talk about it.\n\nIs there a motion?\n\nThank you very much, Madam Chair.\n\nI move that the committee consider amendment number two.\n\nThank you so much, I second the motion.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt's been moved and seconded to adopt amendment two.\n\nCould Council Central staff please describe the amendment?\n\nThank you, Madam Chair.\n\nGreg Doss, Council Central staff.\n\nAs you're aware, in the substitute, section G talks about a threat of harms to others and has officers, when considering making an arrest of an individual, determining a threat of harm to others through their actions, conduct, as to whether or not that individual presents a threat.\n\nWhat this amendment before you would do is to ask that when defined in SPD policies, the threat of harm standard shall be comprised of factors that are related to a potential that physical harm will be inflicted upon a person by another as evidenced by behavior which has caused such harm or which places another person or persons in reasonable fear of sustaining such harm.\n\nAdditionally, such factors may not include the mere use of drugs in public absent additional factors.\n\nThank you, Greg.\n\nCan you also just touch upon how state law relates and where it doesn't?\n\nYeah, thank you.\n\nSo there is a, there is under state law, officers are able to determine when individuals are presenting a likelihood of serious harm and they are able to take into custody an individual to receive a behavioral health evaluation under the Involuntary Treatment Act.\n\nAnd there is specific language in the RCW and it's reflected in SPD policy that determines when individuals are displaying behavior that would allow officers to do that.\n\nThis language mirrors that language in the sense that these characteristics and these behaviors would be identifiable by the individual who would be using or possessing drugs in public.\n\nThe difference would be that this person would not be rising to the level of needing custody or a behavioral health evaluation.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAre there comments from the sponsor?\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nThank you again, Madam Chair.\n\nThanks for seconding this amendment here.\n\nThis amendment, as central staff noted, is really about attempting to safeguard against implicit racial bias.\n\nThis is an attempt here to ensure that there is a true threat of harm and that where we have a defined way to assess that threat of harm that doesn't default to an individual's bias.\n\nWe know that people of color are much more likely to be seen as a threat for the same behavior as their white counterpart.\n\nThis amendment also tries to ensure that people are not becoming involved with the criminal legal system unless they are putting another person's physical safety in danger and that the person cannot be deescalated.\n\nIf that person cannot be deescalated with interventions by LEAD and LEAD being the primary approach and only in the very extreme and very rare cases that people are being booked into jail and offered another off -ramp to LEAD and pretrial diversion.\n\nSo the attempt here is to ensure that physical safety and the physical danger of someone else is clearly defined and that we've used deescalation and intervention strategies first before going to arrest and booking into jail.\n\nAnd finally, this amendment attempts to protect against unnecessary interactions with the legal systems as well as safeguard against misinformation serving as the bias for arrest under this statute.\n\nAnd I wanna underscore the importance of safeguarding against misinformation as serving for the bias of arrest under the statute.\n\nFor example, we all know that it is extremely frustrating and unhealthy for us to have the sense of breathing in secondhand smoke.\n\nBut many people, including today, have commented on secondhand smoke and fentanyl smoke being an example of where they felt their own physical health was in danger.\n\nI wanna point to the fact that our King County Public Health Department has had a recent question and answer session with the director of the Washington Poison Control Center to dispel this myth.\n\nSo this amendment tries to help identify where there's misinformation that could be leading to someone's arrest because a person may feel that their physical health or safety is in danger when in fact secondhand fentanyl smoke, according to the King County Public Health Department, continues to show that bystanders who breathe in secondhand smoke are not physically at risk.\n\nStudies, and I wanna quote from Public Health Insider and from the King County Public Health Department.\n\nQuote, studies have looked at fentanyl concentrations in the bloodstream after someone has had secondhand fentanyl exposure from smoke.\n\nThere is no risk for the everyday person being exposed to secondhand opioid smoke.\n\nWhen someone smokes fentanyl, most of the drug has already been filtered out by the user before there is secondhand smoke.\n\nAnd that comes and it's published from public health on publichealthinsider .com.\n\nThis is from April 5th of 2022, if you wanna look it up under, is it safe question and answer session about secondhand fentanyl smoke.\n\nSo yes, it is important for us to have a clear definition of physical harm so that people aren't making assumptions about what physical harm is and that individuals who are involved in arrests are not defaulting to any bias where they might perceive someone as being a threat when we don't have a clear way of defining threat to a person's physical harm.\n\nI wanna avoid compounding any bias.\n\nAnd again, I wanna lean on public health data.\n\nSo that's the intent of this amendment here, Madam Chair.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAppreciate your explaining your policy basis as well as your advocacy for the clarity of this amendment.\n\nI will have some comments on it before we vote, but I'm gonna defer to Council Member Nelson.\n\nSo your hand is up.\n\nNo, that was, oh, it's an old hand over, sorry.\n\nOkay, so any other comments on this, Council Member Peterson?\n\nThank you, Chair Herbold, and thank you, Council Member Mosqueda for explaining this amendment.\n\nThe big picture for me here is that the state government had a compromise that they crafted carefully, and I would prefer to implement that as is into our Seattle Municipal Code because it was already a compromise on public health and safety.\n\nI think the mayor's additional provisions of harm to self, harm to others add complicating factors for implementation.\n\nI think that if we layer onto that, this amendment, it increases that complexity and potentially a legal risk for the city, and so I'll be voting no on this.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you, Council Member Peterson.\n\nAre there other comments?\n\nWhile my colleagues are considering whether or not they have comments, I'm just gonna speak to why I'm a little torn about this amendment.\n\nI really appreciate how we've been working hand -in -hand with the executive in good faith to create this sort of dual track that is different than what state law proposed.\n\nIt is not in conflict, but it is different because it assumes that a cohort of people who are not harming any others will not be arrested and will be helped with pre -arrest diversion.\n\nI think, for me, the complexity is in the harm to self and harm to others definitions, which will be in future policies developed by the police department.\n\nAnd historically, we've had some challenges with administrative policies that have been sort of overused or improperly used.\n\nI think most recently, we can point to what we refer to colloquially as the MDARs, which allow for encampment removals without advanced notice when they are considered to be obstructions, and the ACLU has sued the city and the court has agreed with their findings that the city is defining too many things as obstructions.\n\nAnd I could see something similar to that happening in this case, that the police policies may define too many things as harm to others, not just harm to self.\n\nSo I really appreciate the sentiment of this amendment, but I also simultaneously am concerned that it may be too narrow.\n\nAnd so I think what I'm inclined to do as it relates to this amendment is to abstain and between now and the full council vote on the legislation have some additional conversations with the executive to get some further understanding and reassurances that the definitions that are yet to be created in the police department policies defining threat of harm to others are not so all encompassing that they basically include everything and really make the intent of this ordinance really undermine the intent of this ordinance.\n\nSo I'm just thinking this, I've been struggling with this one.\n\nCouncil Member Muscata has asked me numerous times how I'm gonna vote and I'm deciding here on the dais that I'm actually going to abstain and saying publicly to the folks representing the executive in the audience today that I look forward to having more conversations with them before full council on this issue.\n\nThank you.\n\nThere are no additional thoughts or comments.\n\nCouncil Member Muscata.\n\nThanks, thank you.\n\nAnd thanks again, Madam Chair, for all the work that you've done on the substitute and the work that we will continue to vote on here today.\n\nI think that it's probably unlikely that there will be a number of amendments on the final, the full council vote.\n\nI'm hoping that won't occur as early as next Tuesday given the work that's still to be done to see what is actually in the budget.\n\nThere was a lot of promises made about alternatives and diversion funding being included in the budget, which we don't receive for another two weeks.\n\nSo my hope is that we'll still have time to see that before a final vote, but I'm guessing that we probably won't have that information and if we don't do more amendments at full council, then this might be our last time to vote on this.\n\nI do appreciate though that folks are acknowledging that there does need to be a tough definition or a more refined definition to the threat of harm.\n\nThe language is in the bill at this point with the sub.\n\nWhat this amendment does is just offer additional clarity to make sure that when we use the words and definition threat of harm, that we have a means to ensure that there is a base level of protection for true threats that is consistent with that state law.\n\nAnd I think that it's especially important to remember that while the consent decree is being lifted, the city of Seattle still is receiving national and state and local headlines for having bias arrests.\n\nAnd Seattle Times 2021 in July headline says, report Seattle police stop black people, Native Americans at far higher rate than white people.\n\nIf that level of bias policing is occurring currently, and we add on to the fact that more people of color are more likely to be unhoused, and if this is really affecting mostly folks who are going to be unhoused and consuming in public, then I think we are doubling down on the potential that there will be additional bias and who is then swept into additional arrests under this new law.\n\nSo again, it is currently illegal to consume in public, but if we are giving further guidance to officers, we should be offering them guidance to not just default to a personal feeling of being unsafe and really have a clear definition of what threat of harm truly is.\n\nThat is why I think it's so important to put that in the legislation here today.\n\nAnd obviously there's many more avenues that we need to continue to address that, not just with this legislation, but I offered that evidence as recently as July of 2021, as offered in the Seattle Times reporting on that watchdog report showing officers, despite nearly a decade of surveillance under the federal oversight entity, continue to stop and use force against black people in the city and Native American folks in the city far more often than white people.\n\nAnd that's a direct quote.\n\nThank you, Madam Chair.\n\nThank you.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson, is that a new hand?\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nYou have four.\n\nI wanna note that I am not struggling at all with my vote on this amendment because it seems to be saying that being exposed and inhaling secondhand fentanyl smoke is not bad enough for officer intervention.\n\nI know that it's being made to sound more complicated, but I don't think that that is a reason for not intervening in public use of drugs in a public place.\n\nSo here we have Reverend Walden here who has spoken publicly about her exposure to fentanyl smoke and I'm just gonna have to say that when you're talking about grabbing headlines, I think that passage of this will grab headlines as well because we're questioning whether or not that is harmful enough.\n\nAnd that is not being what former representative Don Mason says, being a hero.\n\nSo I will be voting no.\n\nThis goes too down a complex rabbit hole for me to vote yes on this.\n\nThank you.\n\nMadam Chair, I just final comment if I might.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nMadam Chair, that proves the point.\n\nAnd that proves the point that this amendment is incredibly important, that we can't rely on people's feelings of being unsafe.\n\nWe have to have a clear definition of what is truly a harm to one's physical safety.\n\nPublic Health Seattle King County and the Washington State Poison Control Center have put out data on their public health sites helping to explain to members of the public that consuming secondhand fentanyl smoke is not a physical harm.\n\nI am not saying it is not something that I wish on anyone, but it is not reason to arrest someone.\n\nThat is what we are trying to define here right now.\n\nWhether or not physical harm is clearly defined is a very important component of this policy.\n\nAnd whether or not someone feels uncomfortable is absolutely something I care about, but it is not justification for arrest when it is not yielding physical harm according to our own Public Health Department and Poison Control Center.\n\nYou have made my point about why this amendment would be incredibly important as a guardrail for offering sideboards to our officers for what defines physical harm.\n\nThe point has been made not only by me, but apparently other members of the committee who are going to be voting now.\n\nSo I appreciate, Madam Chair, that the conversation may continue in other venues.\n\nAnd I look forward to us all continuing to look at public health publications to remember what defines actual physical harm according to our own public health officers.\n\nThank you.\n\nHearing no further comment, will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of Amendment 2.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nNay.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nNo.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nNo.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nAbstain.\n\nOne yes, three no, one abstention.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nThe motion fails.\n\nThe amendment is not adopted and we will move on to the next amendment, Amendment Number 3, which is sponsored by Council Member Mosqueda and myself.\n\nAgain, we'll get the amendment before us and then we can speak to and debate the merits of Amendment 3.\n\nIs there a motion for Amendment Number 3?\n\nMadam Chair, I move the committee consider Amendment Number 3.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nSecond Amendment Number 3.\n\nAnd now that we have the amendment before us, let's get a quick description from Council Central staff and then we'll speak to it.\n\nOkay.\n\nAmendment Number 3 adds three whereas clauses to the recitals in the bill.\n\nAnd these recitals are intended to communicate that the city does support a framework of diversion and a substantial part of that framework, especially when we're talking about pre -booking diversion is the Let Everyone Advance with Dignity, so the LEAD program.\n\nAnd so as long as they have the ability to sufficiently support this population with diversion and the city continues to prioritize referrals from police at the point of arrest for pre -booking diversion, that the city is supporting that framework.\n\nIt just makes the additional point that if at some point there are insufficient resources for pre -booking diversion and this priority of referral through police is still prioritized, that there is a chance that what we call a pre -arrest or social contact diversion could be compromised in that the number of resources are of course limited.\n\nAnd so any prioritization of contacts through police, through law enforcement, if funding is not sufficient to support both kinds of referral could mean that referral into LEAD is more limited to contact with law enforcement.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nSo let's first hear from the sponsors of the amendment.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda, would you like to speak to it?\n\nYeah, Madam Chair, I'm also happy to let you go first and then I can weigh in.\n\nI know you've been a longtime supporter and advocate for funding for LEAD and appreciate your co -sponsorship on this amendment and maybe I can speak to it afterwards.\n\nSure, I just think - I can go now too.\n\nI'll say a few words.\n\nI think the most important part of this amendment is the fact that we are recognizing here today that our strategy for addressing substance use disorder in public places is really dependent on the ability of programs like LEAD who both are integral to pre -booking and pre -arrest diversion strategies.\n\nThat if we do not make sufficient resources to support those programs, then very likely we will result in a policy where the primary entry into the diversion system is contact with law enforcement.\n\nAssuming that the diversion system itself will be funded because again, there are two types of diversion.\n\nThere's diversion that happens without arrest and there's diversion that happens after arrest but before charges are filed.\n\nIt is incredibly important that we make sure that we are properly resourcing both of these strategies.\n\nAnd it's really important that we go into creating policy with our eyes wide open about the importance of these resources.\n\nSo really appreciate Council Member Mosqueda both as the budget chair and the prime sponsor of this amendment bringing this forward.\n\nSo we have the opportunity to speak about how important this funding is to our community safety continuum while we have representatives of the mayor's office in the audience with us today.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nGreat, thank you very much Madam Chair and thanks again for your leadership.\n\nAlso as vice chair for the budget committee, I think that with you and members of this council, we have had to lead on finding additional funding, one -time funding sources to plug funding gaps in the LEAD program.\n\nWe have been happy to try to do that with the vice chair and other council members over the last few years to ensure that the LEAD program led by our friends who were previously part of the PDA, we wanna make sure that the various programs and strategies that they are deploying to reach people where they are at and to make sure that services are being delivered by trusted community partners whose relationships take time and investment that they have the funding.\n\nSo we have spent the last three years finding one -time funding sources to plug that gap at LEAD.\n\nWithout seeing the budget before this bill comes forward, I don't have any assurances that there is going to be the funding gap filled again.\n\nAccording to PDA and LEAD, they felt that they had to absorb about an $8 million gap in the 2023 budget before we were able to find additional funding to plug some of that last year.\n\nAnd they are projecting that they will need to have somewhere between six to $8 million more in next year's budget, thinking that they can absorb possibly a $2 million gap to accept all of SPD referrals.\n\nBut if the funding gap from last year is the same, it will start to impugn our ability to actually do what this bill purports that it will do.\n\nIf we don't fill this funding gap, it will harm LEAD and PDA's ability to accept referrals, which are the centerpiece of what supposedly makes this bill different from previous iterations.\n\nAnd we have to have that funding accounted for to ensure that LEAD has the diversion capacity to ensure that people are not being arrested first.\n\nThe pre -arrest diversion component of this legislation is truly what makes it stand out and is unique, and that requires funding.\n\nI look forward to working with members of this council and the executive to ensure that that funding gap is not experienced again this year, but anywhere near the expected funding gap for 2024 will result in a cut in their ability to accept all SPD referrals.\n\nWe have a big budget deficit in the hundreds of millions of dollars coming up after next year.\n\nEveryone knows that.\n\nEveryone should have that front and center.\n\nAnd I know CBO and the executive do have that front and center.\n\nThat is why I'm concerned with any ability to add millions of dollars to programs and to especially ensure that we are doubling down on policy that assumes that money will be there.\n\nMakes me nervous about the ability to fulfill the promise that's being outlined here.\n\nGiven that we don't have an answer yet on the budget, there is not room for someone in, sorry.\n\nGiven that we don't have answers on what happens when there is not room for someone in diversion, even though we've tried to guard against that by including language in this legislation saying that when there is no room in the appropriate treatment, that is not a reason to arrest people.\n\nI'm still very concerned about the policy without the funding attached.\n\nLEAD has assured us that their current level of funding, that they are prepared to prioritize their services.\n\nThey will prioritize all SPD referrals so that no one needs to be turned away for lack of access to diversion programming.\n\nHowever, again, it makes it so effectively that the only entry point to LEAD is by a police officer as they will need to scale down other referrals they accept to ensure that there's proportional increase to SPD referrals.\n\nSo my hope here is that we can sustain and expand LEAD diversion capacity with this amendment.\n\nBut again, I wanna emphasize the importance of this actually having the funding in the budget to make sure that this is not a false promise.\n\nAnd I would very much prefer to see the budget before we advance the policy.\n\nI'm hoping that this policy amendment here helps to align our goals and future work on the budget.\n\nThank you, Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nI'll be brief on this amendment.\n\nJust wanna speak to my personal experience of working with law enforcement assisted diversion as a public safety partner, particularly in the downtown core of the city.\n\nI really do think we have shown a way in Seattle to have this really fundamental leg of the stool as a public safety service that complements fire, police and emergency medical technicians in a way that adds new capacity, that is harm reduction informed, that is focused on root causes.\n\nWorking during the COVID era on encampment resolutions with Just Care, a program of the Public Defender Association in partnership with other organizations was a really eyeopening policy experience for me.\n\nThere are still hotel shelters that the co -lead team is operating in the city of Seattle that have saved lives, that have gotten people into housing, that have made our community safer.\n\nAnd that they have kept those hotel shelters well run and with good relations with the surrounding community where the sheltering program themselves has also not been a contributor to perceptions of public order or public safety.\n\nAnd they've been good neighbors and actually improved public safety demonstrated by 911 data in the areas where they have cited their sheltering.\n\nI really think it's important to highlight and elevate this work because it is fundamental to the approach that we as a council and mayor are centering with this legislation and very enthusiastically support this amendment and look forward to moving on to the budget cycle where we can start talking about how to continue to adequately resource lead to have the impact that we want it to have.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nThank you, Chair Herbold.\n\nAnd I appreciate the intent of this because you need to have the funding backing the alternatives.\n\nAnd my concern here is that we're calling out a single organization which could imply a sole source award of funding.\n\nIn the future, this is gonna be, we're referencing a Seattle Municipal Code update that we're doing.\n\nAnd so I wonder if the authors of this would be willing, and maybe if it's not today, at full council, but to basically just change, say, the let everyone advance with dignity lead program or similar programs, just so it's not just calling out one organization forever as if that would be the only organization to ever receive this.\n\nI mean, we may wanna be growing that ecosystem, having more nonprofits doing this work on top of the great work that LEAD has done.\n\nMaybe the Human Services Department will do some of this directly.\n\nI just don't know.\n\nAnd I just wouldn't wanna call out just a single organization.\n\nSo there could be an amendment just saying, or other programs that would satisfy me.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd just to respond to that, this is a common theme that we hear over having similar conversations with King County.\n\nThe organization that is the project manager is the PDA, but LEAD is not an organization.\n\nLEAD is a program that could be, that has particular components of the program that make it have fidelity with the approach that we know works.\n\nThere are dozens and dozens of LEAD programs throughout the country.\n\nPDA doesn't run them all everywhere.\n\nBut again, LEAD is a model.\n\nAnd it is a model that result, that is dependent on somebody acting as program manager and several providers working under that program management to deliver care and services.\n\nSo given that we don't, LEAD does not have to be operated by PDA.\n\nIt can be operated by anybody.\n\nAnd currently King County has just done an RFP for LEAD, opening it up to other applicants to deliver the services in the program model that has fidelity with the LEAD program.\n\nAnd so that fidelity with those principles is incredibly important.\n\nAnd that's why we refer to LEAD in the amendment itself.\n\nAnd just to make a finer point on it, the RFP that the county recently did for the LEAD program was open to other people to apply, not just the PDA.\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nAny other comments or questions?\n\nThanks, Madam Chair.\n\nI would just also note that we're talking about recitals, right?\n\nPlaces where we note findings.\n\nIt is noted here as a finding that the framework of the LEAD program is efficient and effective.\n\nAnd that is, I think, a difference than of the type of amendment we're talking about here.\n\nOften when we do amendments in the budget and we're trying to be prescriptive to departments about what needs funding, we will say programs such as LEAD or entities such as PDA.\n\nSo I understand the point.\n\nThank you, Council Member Peterson, and agree with you in concept on when we're dealing with the budget.\n\nBut here I think we're talking about the type of programs that are required to ensure the effectiveness of the referral program and the diversion strategies that are going to make this a different approach.\n\nAnd I think it's appropriate in the whereas's to note LEAD as a program that has proven track record.\n\nI also though wanna, again, underscore the importance here of us waiting on acting on this legislation until we have assurances that that funding is directed in the budget.\n\nHowever, the executive decides to write that as some sort of assurances that the other half or the counter to the proposal here is truly funded.\n\nBut I appreciate the clarification, Madam Chair, that you offered and just wanted to offer that as well given that this is in the recitals.\n\nThank you, Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nI'm not seeing any additional comments or questions.\n\nClerk, please call the roll on adoption of Amendment 3.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nAbstain.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nAbstain.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nYes.\n\nThree yes, two abstentions.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nThe motion carries.\n\nThe amendment is adopted.\n\nWe can move on to the next amendment, Amendment Number 4.\n\nAlso sponsored by Council Member Mosqueda and myself.\n\nLet's get it in front of us.\n\nIs there a motion to move forward Amendment 4?\n\nI will move Amendment 4.\n\nIs there a second?\n\nSecond.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt's been moved and seconded to adopt Amendment 4.\n\nCould Council Central staff please describe the amendment?\n\nRight.\n\nProposed Amendment 4 to Council Bill 120645 would add into the legislation reference to the RCW Section 10 .05, which is a deferred prosecution statute.\n\nThe amendment adds a couple recitals just describing the addition and the reasons why.\n\nBut what this essentially would do would incorporate into 12A -09 -020, which is the part of the bill that adopts RCW sections.\n\nThe state legislature's deferred prosecution program.\n\nIn addition, it provides in that section additional guidance for offenses other than those referenced in RCW 10 .05, which are domestic violence offenses, traffic infractions, and criminal mistreatment offenses.\n\nAnd so this is intended to apply to all other misdemeanors and gross misdemeanors that specifically have a nexus to, sorry, a nexus between defendant's conduct and an underlying substance use disorder and or a mental health disorder.\n\nAnd it provides some guidance to the court about how to use deferred prosecution in those circumstances.\n\nI just note that this is not mandating the municipal court to do any deferred prosecution cases.\n\nIt's just providing some legislative guidance about how to do things like treatment terms for deferred prosecution cases.\n\nIt matches the requirements for periodic reporting to the court and prosecutor, as well as the defense on the defendant's progress.\n\nAnd it makes sure that admissions made by a defendant in the course of receiving deferred prosecution can't be used against the defendant in the prosecution's case.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda, would you like to speak to the amendment?\n\nSure, thank you.\n\nAnd again, thanks for your partnership on this, Madam Chair.\n\nI just wondered as well for the viewing public if we wanted to pull it up on the screen to share some of the content of the amendment.\n\nIt was also published with the agenda.\n\nSo thank you so much to everyone who made that possible.\n\nI wanna just note my interest in this, adding to what Asha said very briefly, by resolving at least some cases more quickly than traditional prosecution and tailoring conditions to connect individuals facing charges who are suffering from substance use disorders and or mental health disorders with services in a timely manner.\n\nThis tool can help reduce recidivism and promote public safety.\n\nThe proposed deferred prosecution process would allow judges to set individual conditions for each person in front of them and then dismiss the case once they determine a person has successfully met conditions set by the court.\n\nAnd I know, Madam Chair, you've spent a lot of time working on this as well, or this concept.\n\nSo I appreciate your work on this.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nJust a couple words to add to Asha's explanation in your words, Council Member Esqueda.\n\nUnder this law, we assume that some people will be diverted without being arrested.\n\nSome people will be diverted after arrest, but before booking.\n\nAnd some people will not be diverted.\n\nAnd so this creates an opportunity for the use of an existing deferred prosecution program in order to, again, reduce the negative impacts of the criminal legal system.\n\nAs Asha explained, the program does not mandate the municipal court to take any specific mandatory actions within a specific timeframe.\n\nAnd we recognize that the ability of the Seattle Municipal Court to stand up a deferred prosecution program is contingent on resources.\n\nBut this is simply proposed to allow for another approach to reduce the negative impacts of the criminal legal system of folks that there is a prosecution moving forward.\n\nAnd it's specifically and narrowly focused on those individuals where there's a nexus between an individual's behavior and the substance use disorder with the underlying charge.\n\nSo again, I appreciate Council Member Mosqueda for being the prime sponsor on this one.\n\nAnd I'm also very supportive of, again, creating opportunities for diversion across the continuum.\n\nLet's see if we have other comments.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis, I think you were first in the queue.\n\nThank you so much, Chair Herbold.\n\nI think this is a really intriguing amendment.\n\nWhen I was an assistant city attorney, I did have cases that resolved as a deferred prosecution.\n\nDeferred prosecutions are not the most common diversion that we use in the municipal court.\n\nI actually think that they're very uncommon because the terms and conditions of a deferred prosecution are very intensive.\n\nTypically applied in DUIs, as the description of the amendment implies.\n\nRequires intensive outpatient drug and alcohol treatment.\n\nTypically requires complete sobriety as one of the conditions of completing the program.\n\nSo it is not typically something that people who are charged in the municipal court seek to take advantage of for a DUI unless the evidence is pretty significant and they're willing to engage in that intensive program.\n\nThere's a high rate of failure for deferred prosecutions.\n\nSo from that standpoint, just for members of the public, just to state it, a deferred prosecution is a great opportunity for people to take advantage of, but it is not easy for people to do.\n\nBut I do think it could apply to cases like this, situations like this, where there is a nexus with addiction for folks.\n\nThat said, that is not currently what is allowed per the RCWs which control, the RCW which controls the applicability of how deferred prosecutions in Washington State work.\n\nSo I am not really sure how, through our municipal code, we would be able to facilitate this.\n\nBut what I think that this does put before the council in an interesting way is maybe a conversation around how some supplemental work could be done at the state level to look at ways to apply deferred prosecutions to these cases as one of the tools or tactics that the state wants courts of limited jurisdiction to be able to provide in these cases.\n\nMight be something to look into and talk to our legislative delegation about.\n\nBut there are other diversion and other things short of going to trial that we do have as part of our practice locally that might be more appropriate, like pre -filed diversion, which in our supplemental budget we recently increased.\n\nSo given that this particular concept is kind of coming a little later in our process too, I'm gonna vote no on this amendment today, but I think it does invite a policy conversation we should engage with the legislature about for this being one of the tools that we can potentially use.\n\nThank you, Council Member Lewis.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nWell, I actually like the deferred prosecution program because it is rigorous and despite what Council Member Lewis just said about it not working for everyone, it worked for my dad and that's how he got sober.\n\nSo just wanted to note that this is an effective program for enough people to save enough lives for me to be in support of it.\n\nOn August 14th, I referenced a letter we had received from the Department of Public Defense and SEIU 925 stating their staunch opposition to aligning with state law and asking that it be amended, the proposed legislation, that it be amended to grant Seattle Municipal Court judges the authority to divert cases for treatment.\n\nAnd back then I said that that would be illegal because the power to create a judicial diversion program is vested solely in the state legislature under Article 4, Sections 1 and 12 of the Washington State Constitution and the Seattle Municipal Court jurisdiction and power is derived from the legislature per RCW 3520.\n\nAnd so basically that was a way for me to say that we don't have the authority to do that.\n\nNow this amendment doesn't create a whole new judicial diversion program, instead it expands an existing one, but that too is an impermissible change to state law which is beyond Council's authority.\n\nSo I'm gonna be voting no against this\n\nBut\n\nI also want to say that from the get -go I've been saying that I will oppose any attempt to interfere with the city attorney's prosecutorial discretion and this does do that.\n\nIt is an attempt to usurp those decisions and so that's, I'm maintaining consistency and will be voting no for that reason as well.\n\nThank you, Council Member Nelson.\n\nThere any other closing comments on Amendment 4? Madam Chair.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda, yes.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nYou know, I just, I wonder if there's any comments from central staff about the concern about the legality or the approach here.\n\nObviously every amendment that we put forward goes through the law department.\n\nThis one has, it has not been walked on.\n\nThis is not coming in late.\n\nIt's part of the normal process where it went through the law legal review.\n\nAnd we have on central staff our own legal analysis, analysts also who assured us that it is consistent with state law.\n\nSo just to make sure that we have clarification on the legislation or the amendment in front of us, it might be helpful to hear from central staff if there's any feedback on some of the concerns raised.\n\nYes, and I think it's, we do need to be careful about talking about legal advice, whether or not we're talking about legal advice from the city attorney or legal advice from the council, council, but handing it over to council central staff if they have anything to add.\n\nYeah, I just have to refer you back to the memos from the city attorney's office and any information from our legislative council that they've provided to you in privileged form.\n\nI'm afraid I can't speak too much more than that.\n\nThank you, Asha.\n\nAppreciate that.\n\nThank you.\n\nAll right, not seeing any further comments.\n\nPausing, still none.\n\nOkay, with that, please call the roll on the adoption of amendment four.\n\nCouncil member Mosqueda.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil member Nelson.\n\nNo.\n\nVice chair Lewis.\n\nNo.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nYes.\n\nTwo yes, three no.\n\nI don't think you called all committee members.\n\nYeah, yes.\n\nSorry.\n\nAnd just to get everybody's vote on the record.\n\nChair Herbold, yes.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd I don't know if you got council member Peterson, but I'm a no.\n\nOh, you skipped you too.\n\nMy apologies.\n\nAll right, well.\n\nAm I that predictable, Newell?\n\nMe too.\n\nIt's what happens when he's filling in the answers before the vote.\n\nThe motion fails and the amendment is not adopted.\n\nLet's move on to amendment number five.\n\nCouncil member Peterson.\n\nSo this amendment, again, sponsored by council member Peterson.\n\nLet's get it in front of us.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you, chair.\n\nColleagues, I move to adopt amendment five to council bill 120645 as shown on the committee's agenda.\n\nSecond.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt's been moved and seconded to adopt amendment five.\n\nCould council central staff please describe the amendment?\n\nSo amendment five to council bill 120645.\n\nIt adds some recitals that speak to some of the proposed amendment language.\n\nEssentially what this amendment asks is that the officer of the inspector general for public safety or a research -based organization that OIG chooses to engage with, as well as SPD, work with the city attorney's office, the Seattle municipal court, the fire department, and any other relevant departments to obtain data that I'll describe in this next subsection and provide that data to the council by January 1st, 2025 and for the next few years up until 2030.\n\nThe intent for the data collection is for OIG to take a look at the data that's described in subsections one through 12 with the intent of using that data and any other data that they think is necessary to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of this ordinance.\n\nThe intent is for OIG to provide recommendations both about data collection, to the extent that any of the data that SPD or other departments are collecting is operationally difficult and provide some recommendations about how to better operationalize that data collection to help the city to improve how it would assess the effectiveness of the ordinance.\n\nThe preliminary report is requested by June 30th of 2025 and final written recommendations are intended to come to the council by the end of the year in 2025 and then annually again until 2030.\n\nJust to note about the timing there, the intent is for OIG to be able to look at a year's worth of data and so assuming that this, if this ordinance were to pass, it would be able to look at the data collected throughout 2024 to be able to assess the effectiveness of the legislation.\n\nAs noted in the amendment itself, there's 12 different areas of data collection.\n\nWe're looking at the number of drug overdoses on a quarterly basis, the number of shootings in which drugs were present or an individual was under the influence of drugs on a quarterly basis, the number of 911 calls about the use of controlled substances in public also on a quarterly basis and all of those are intended to be data collection from between 2019 through 2023.\n\nThe number of documented contacts between officers that includes community service officers and individuals encountered in enforcing these crimes, the number of attempts by police officers to contact and coordinate efforts for diversion, outreach and other alternatives, the number of arrests for the crimes, the number of individuals that are transported for booking at the jail of that number, those who are actually booked into jail, those that the jail did not accept, those individuals transported to a medical facility instead of being booked into jail and those released without being booked or being transported to a medical facility.\n\nFrom the city attorney's office, the number of possession and public use cases that are referred for prosecution, the number of cases from the number that are referred that are dismissed before or during trial and that would include pre -filing diversion, the reasons for dismissal of those cases, the results of any interviews that OIG conducts with SPD personnel who have experience in the field enforcing this legislation and then any other information that OIG thinks would be helpful for the purposes of conducting this review.\n\nThe last piece of this addition is asking SPD officers to collect to the extent that it's practicable for them, contact with individuals in pursuit of enforcement of these crimes as well as the number of attempts to contact and coordinate diversion efforts.\n\nIf SPD can't collect that data, SPD and OIG will try and figure out collecting data from service providers.\n\nI'll turn it back over to Council Member Peterson.\n\nThank you.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nThank you.\n\nI wanna thank central staff and the Office of Inspector General for their hard work and collaboration in crafting this amendment for me so that it can truly be helpful for everyone.\n\nColleagues, this amendment requests our Office of Inspector General to lead the effort to collect and share data with the public and the city council to assess the effectiveness of this new legislation including how the mayor's unique provisions regarding harm and diversion impact SPD's ability to do its job.\n\nThis amendment asks for recommendations to approve this policy in the future if warranted.\n\nAnd for better or worse, this new legislation forges new ground and puts Seattle in a unique and untested situation different from the compromise the state government crafted four months ago.\n\nSo due to that uncertainty on whether that legislation will be effective in real life, I believe collecting and reporting this information is a sensible addition.\n\nAnd as central staff noted, this would eventually sunset so this does not go on forever.\n\nSo passing this amendment on reporting is very important for me to support this legislation overall.\n\nSo thank you for your consideration.\n\nThank you.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nLooking to see if there are additional comments.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis.\n\nThank you, Chair Herbold.\n\nVery strongly support this amendment from Council Member Peterson.\n\nI think as a general practice, we as a council should incorporate feedback loop amendments like this into more work that we do that triggers services from the Office of the Inspector General or for non -public safety related matters from the city auditor as a way to foster a climate of ongoing improvement and ongoing reflection on policies and priorities.\n\nAnd this information around data collection and lining up that accountability comports with what I think we should be doing more broadly.\n\nSo I support this amendment and appreciate Council Member Peterson bringing it forward.\n\nThank you, Council Member Lewis.\n\nJust wanna speak to my support for the amendment as well.\n\nAppreciate the focus on data collection and also want to reference that I did speak to the Inspector General and she is supportive of doing this work as well, which is important to my support.\n\nSo with that, if there are no additional comments or questions, will the clerk please call Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAnd thanks to Council Member Peterson for the data collection amendment.\n\nThere is some work that we wanted to do together in the upcoming budget around data collection, but this amendment, and I went back to look at it again after our conversation this morning, this amendment is not just about the data.\n\nI think that there's unnecessary language that tries to rehash the conversation that we had this spring in reference to the other bill that had zero committee hearings, no opportunity for true community engagement.\n\nAnd it just doesn't seem necessary to include that language in this.\n\nLike what we're doing is just focusing on the data that needs to be collected.\n\nSo I think I'm gonna be a no on this amendment.\n\nIt sounds like there's the votes there, but I do look forward to working with the sponsor of this amendment on upcoming language that we're collectively working on for additional data in other arenas as well.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThere's no further comment.\n\nI'd love to get to the vote.\n\nMr. Cooper.\n\nCouncil Member Herbold.\n\nSorry, just one note on process.\n\nI realized that this amendment is drafted to amend the bill as introduced rather than the substitute.\n\nSo when you're voting on it, if you could just have it be an amendment to the substitute, I can make all the appropriate reference corrections.\n\nAll right.\n\nWill the clerk please call Madam Chair?\n\nI think that there has to be a motion to change the motion.\n\nI don't know that there does.\n\nI think if I call for the vote with the reference to the substitute, we're good.\n\nI'm seeing nodding heads at the table.\n\nCouncil Member Skada, there are nodding heads at the table.\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nWill the clerk please call the roll on amendment five, version one as an amendment to the substitute?\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nNo.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nYes.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nYes.\n\nFour yes, one no.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe motion carries and the amendment is adopted.\n\nAnd we have a couple of amendments that are walk -ons that were not on the agenda for today.\n\nBut we will definitely hear them if the sponsor is planning on bringing them forward.\n\nAll right.\n\nSo I think we'll, I was uncertain whether or not you were intending to bring them forward.\n\nAnd if there's -\n\nYeah, I'll move them if you would like.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo we will still move them and get them in front of us because we do intend to vote on them contrary to the uncertainty that you had expressed at the beginning.\n\nSo, all right.\n\nCause I just wanted to, if you weren't intending to do so but still wanted to talk to them, I was trying to create space to talk to the amendments without getting them in front of us.\n\nAnd I hear you.\n\nSo I don't think that any space needs to be created if I'm not gonna try to vote.\n\nSo next up is amendment six sponsored by Council Member Nelson.\n\nCan I have a motion please?\n\nI move adoption of amendment six to the substitute.\n\nAll right.\n\nIt's been moved and seconded to adopt amendment number six.\n\nCould council central staff please describe the amendment?\n\nSo amendment six, sorry.\n\nAmendment six would make one change to the section about threat of harm to others and the assessment that the officer needs to make.\n\nAs you'll see reflected in the language, instead of officers will determine whether the individual through their actions and conduct presents a threat of harm to others, that will language is changed to may and in moving it from mandatory to discretionary language, no longer mandates that the officer make such an assessment.\n\nTurn it back over to Council Member Nelson.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson, would you like to speak to your amendment?\n\nYes, so thank you.\n\nI indicated earlier that although the proposed substitute clarifies that the threat of harm assessment is not an element of the crime, the adequacy of the assessment may be raised at trial and could jeopardize the criminal prosecution or later expose the city.\n\nThat's what I was trying to get at.\n\nI now have a script that I'm allowed to say.\n\nI believe the present version creates an unacceptable level of risk for the city.\n\nI'm not going to go into attorney -client privileged advice, but that here are the practical concerns for officers and prosecutors that my amendments seek to relieve.\n\nThey include, one, burdens and confusion for the prosecution of criminal cases, two, time burdens and confusion for officers that are trying to enforce our laws, and three, and generally bad consequences and risks for implementation.\n\nI've talked to my colleagues and attorneys and believe these amendments reduce the challenges that I see.\n\nAnd I'm referring to this one and the following one.\n\nSo basically, because the assessment of the threat of harm could lead to some unintended consequences, I am proposing, even though the new version of the substitute is better that you circulated this morning, I am proposing removing the mandatory directive to determine the threat of harm by changing it from will to may.\n\nThank you, Council Member Nelson.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis, I see your hand is up.\n\nThank you, Council Member Herbold.\n\nI'm actually inclined, I'll speak to both amendments six and seven, which do similar things in one set of remarks.\n\nI'm actually inclined to support these amendments for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that, as has been well established, although it's not universally accurately reported, the City Council cannot order the police to do anything.\n\nThe mayor and the chief of police direct the policy at the discretion of the department and not the City Council.\n\nSo the language that we put into statute, whether it is will or may, is gonna have the same practical effect in terms of the feedback that we are providing to the department.\n\nThe second consideration is related to the first in that we know that this ordinance is going to kick off complementing executive actions that the mayor's office and the police department are going to be pursuing, that we call out in the ordinance and that have been part of our process over the last couple of months.\n\nSo to the extent that more prescriptive language that we have been workshopping and working with constituencies on is warranted, that language would probably be better reflected in executive policy rather than in the ordinance itself.\n\nSo for those reasons, I think that this language helps to provide that flexibility given that we know in advance what the intent of the executive is going to be in these enforcement and in how they want to enforce the ordinance.\n\nWe know in advance what the strategy is going to be from Mayor Harrell.\n\nAnd the more prescriptive language could be included in those actions and that's probably a better place to put them.\n\nSo for that reason, I think that this language better reflects what the role of the council should be in this and continues to complement the overall strategy that we're pursuing.\n\nThank you, Council Member Lewis.\n\nOther comments?\n\nI have a few comments myself.\n\nI feel like the language, I appreciate where this is coming from, but I think throughout this, we have talked about the threat of harm standard being an exercise of discretion.\n\nAnd we expect our officers to use their discretion and to make these determinations.\n\nI'm just concerned that the message that this sends is that the use of discretion is discretionary.\n\nAnd that is not my intention for this policy.\n\nI appreciate that the policies, as Council Member Lewis say, may be the more appropriate place to define the discretionary decision -making that the executive is directing police officers to make.\n\nBut I feel like inserting the word may where currently the word will is included is suggesting that the use of discretion is discretionary.\n\nAnd police officers make decisions based on their assessment of the totality of the circumstances, including how the unlawful acts are affecting others and surroundings.\n\nAnd I feel that inserting the word may here suggests that we don't actually want police officers to use discretion.\n\nAnd I don't feel that that's the intent of the ordinance.\n\nLooking for other comments or questions.\n\nNot seeing any.\n\nPlease call the roll.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nNo.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nYes.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nNo.\n\nThree yes, two no.\n\nThank you, the motion carries and the amendment is adopted.\n\nNext up is Amendment 7, also sponsored by Council Member Nelson.\n\nIs there a motion?\n\nI move the adoption of Amendment 7 to the substitute.\n\nSecond.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt has been moved and seconded to adopt Amendment 7.\n\nCould central staff please describe the amendment?\n\nAmendment number 7 to Council Bill 120645.\n\nSimilarly, it moves language that would have required an officer to attempt to contact and coordinate efforts for diversion, outreach, or other alternatives to arrest from mandatory to discretionary, and strikes the reference to the reasonable attempt and just leaves the language as an officer may attempt to contact and coordinate efforts.\n\nIt strikes language that was included in the substitute that would, excuse me, exempt officers from such a requirement if the appropriate or most viable care strategy is transport.\n\nIt includes language that adds an officer may arrest at their discretion to avoid additional self -harm.\n\nAnd lastly, it strikes language that would have asked SPD policies or training to identify what additional articulable facts and circumstances would warrant arrest in the section in which the ordinance states that the officer would not arrest unless the individual poses a threat of harm to self absent those facts and circumstances.\n\nTurn it back over to Council Member Nelson.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nAgain, same argument as above.\n\nI am changing mandatory to discretionary language with may, and the other items in here are, I think, confusing.\n\nThey confuse the officer's decision in the moment, and they confuse what we are expecting them to do.\n\nIt just creates so many different options for actions that I think that it just makes this law very complex.\n\nAnd so that is why I put this forward.\n\nThank you, Council Member Nelson.\n\nOther comments?\n\nSeeing no comments, will the clerk please call the roll on the amendment?\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nNo.\n\nCouncil Member Nelson.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil Member Peterson.\n\nYes.\n\nVice Chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nNo.\n\nThree yes, two no.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThe amendment is adopted, and we now have the underlying bill before us.\n\nWe have considered amendments, and now let's return to the main motion.\n\nAre there further comments on Council Bill 1206 .45 as amended?\n\nCouncil Member Lewis.\n\nThat is an old hand, Chair Herbold, but I will make just a couple of closing remarks.\n\nAppreciate the process this morning of going through a comprehensive array of amendments that touch lots of different aspects of this policy.\n\nReally looking forward to bringing this conversation to full council and the subsequent conversations around the complementing executive actions that we have been discussing.\n\nWith our partners in the mayor's office.\n\nI want to thank Camila Brown and my staff for staffing my office through this process.\n\nI want to thank Mayor Harrell for his leadership in convening a broad array of stakeholders in law enforcement, public health, to hammer out this proposal.\n\nAnd I want to thank Director Meyerberg for being the primary staffer in the mayor's office for working this policy through in a very engaging and collegial way with a very diverse array of people who don't always agree on things and doing it with consummate skill.\n\nSo with that, I'll reserve the balance of my remarks for when we discuss this at full council, but appreciate the process.\n\nChair Herbold, this morning, and look forward to final action.\n\nCouncil Member Lewis, Council Member Peterson.\n\nThank you, Chair Herbold.\n\nColleagues, I'm sure it comes as no surprise that I wish the city council had simply voted for the conforming legislation that Council Member Nelson and I crafted with the city attorney, Anne Davison, on June 6th, more than three months ago, to implement the public health and public safety compromise crafted by our democratic governor and state legislature.\n\nBut our local effort to simply implement the state compromise failed by a vote of four votes in favor, five votes against.\n\nAnd so here we are, even though cities across the state have adopted the state's public safety law.\n\nI appreciate our mayor and his team stepping up to craft revised legislation.\n\nAll the people who served on the task force who leaned into this so that we could earn additional support from the city council because I believe it's not acceptable for the city of Seattle to remain an outlier on this public health and safety legislation.\n\nWe're overdue for getting these provisions into our Seattle Municipal Code.\n\nI believe that the amendments adopted by our Public Safety Committee today make this legislation better.\n\nI'm especially grateful for the adoption of my amendment to require additional data and reporting so that policymakers will have the information they need to assess whether the legislation is working or not.\n\nSo I'll be voting yes today on this amended legislation and also open to additions during the debate at full council.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you, Council Member Peterson.\n\nA few words for myself as the sponsor of this legislation.\n\nI want to thank the mayor's office for the collaboration on the bill.\n\nI want to thank council members on this committee for their work on the bill.\n\nWe, again, know that state law applies in the city of Seattle and it has applied in the city of Seattle.\n\nThis law is in effect, but this, well, the state law is in effect, but this law, the law before us today, again, states that diversion is the preferred approach and this takes place before any arrest in many cases.\n\nAn earlier update states that the police department, shall collect data on the racial composition of those arrested and diverted, booked and referred for prosecution.\n\nDiversion services, such as lead, reach, and we deliver care are key elements to the success of this approach.\n\nI do have some concerns with the late breaking amendments to the bill, but again, since the bill states throughout that diversion is the preferred policy approach and it refers both to diversion that happens before arrest and diversion that happens after arrest, the concern that I have about the change of the words will to may in several places and how that might impact officer discretion.\n\nI look forward to discussing the impact of those changes with the executive and how they intend to administer the program.\n\nAgain, the fact that we have said throughout the bill in multiple places that diversion is the preferred approach and that in order to implement any type of diversion, officer discretion must be used.\n\nI think given that, that is, makes me feel like the changes in the, in amendments six and seven are really functionally designed to address legal concerns that we've heard as the sponsor said and will not change the underlying impact of the bill, which is to create a framework for officer discretion that is necessary to implement any type of diversion program, whether pre -arrest or post -arrest.\n\nSo with that, I'm looking to see if there are any other comments.\n\nCouncil Member Mosqueda.\n\nI see your hand is up.\n\nThank you, Madam Chair.\n\nYou know, I want to start with where I think that there's universal interest across the council and across the community.\n\nAnd where I think that there's universal interest and common ground is trying to help people who are in a moment of public health crisis and have addiction as a public health issue that they are addressing.\n\nI think there's universal interest in making sure that people, whether they're in the community or whether they're living unhoused or housed, have access to services that they need to get sober and to get stable and to use the tools at our disposal to try to get more people into the healthcare they need.\n\nI hear people say that.\n\nI hear the universal concepts around that.\n\nBut that is not what we are doing today.\n\nWhat we are doing today does not universally address this common ground to try to get us to get more people into the services they need.\n\nIt is doubling down on a state strategy that is already in statute.\n\nIt is already the law of Seattle and the law of the state that you cannot consume in public.\n\nAnd officers already have the direction to arrest people for what the state has decided is illegal behavior.\n\nWhat we could be doing instead today is investing in where it sounds like there's universal interest in supporting the Public Defenders Association and the LEAD program to support more people getting into pre -arrest diversion strategies, to get into getting clinical health services, into getting into public health treatment programs.\n\nWe know we don't have the infrastructure currently to do that.\n\nWe could be spending our time working across community and across this council and with the executive to invest funds and stand up programs and to support the crisis center levy that just passed to expedite the services that universally people say they want.\n\nI want people to get access to public health services just as much as the people who testified in support of this legislation say they want.\n\nBut that is not what this legislation does.\n\nAnd without the funding that is purported to come with this bill, we have no assurances that there will be the alternative structures and programs and diversion strategies to prevent people from going to jail.\n\nWe do not have to pass this legislation.\n\nIt is not a requirement that local jurisdictions codify what the state legislature already passed.\n\nThe conversation that we could be having with King County Prosecutor's Office is about how we could support them with additional resources and services they need instead of offering additional prosecutorial authority to our own city department.\n\nI want us to be spending our time and investments on focusing on how we get people into public health services, not how we double down and recreate a punitive system within our own city to try to prosecute more people.\n\nWithout assurances that there will be funding for LEAD and organizations that support pre -arrest diversion strategies, we are putting the cart before the horse.\n\nWe do not know that these conversations that folks have had about the budget will materialize.\n\nWe cannot be voting on our hopes or rumors or what was the word that was used earlier from my colleague the assurances that have been given without actually seeing the budget to ensure that funding will go in to pre -arrest diversion programs.\n\nWe do know the dangers of arresting people who are dealing with the public health crisis of addiction.\n\nAnd the dangers include death within jails and higher rates of overdose and death when they exit jails.\n\nWe are going to see people suffer more from this public health crisis if we don't compliment this type of policy with the known investments that are needed in public health diversion strategies.\n\nWe are going to see more, especially black, brown and indigenous folks arrested because we have taken away the sideboards that we worked on so hard over the last three to four weeks to try to ensure that bias and a known definition of harm to oneself or others was codified in here.\n\nWe aren't doing that.\n\nWe are taking away these sideboards and we are also putting the cart before the horse before we know that any pre -arrest diversion strategies are actually in place and funded.\n\nWe don't have the language from the executive order.\n\nWe don't have the budget in front of us.\n\nAnd now we've taken away the sideboards that were included in the substitute that the chair worked so hard on.\n\nI was not part of these conversations that indicate that there's any foreshadowing that funding is coming.\n\nI know because I've been involved in the conversations about how bad the budget situation will be in about 14 months.\n\nWe all should be collectively wondering and very curious about where any additional funding is coming from.\n\nAnd to say that there's $27 million being associated with this piece of legislation.\n\nI again wanna clarify for the record that 7 million of that funding comes from funding that is typically used in HSD to fund community priorities.\n\nI understand that there's underfund and $7 million is going to be freed up to go to these efforts.\n\nBut it is false to assume that $27 million is somehow going to materialize in new programs and services being stood up and that there's resources at our fingertips when there is not.\n\nBecause 20 million of those dollars come annually.\n\nAnd once you take out the funding that King County and the city holds back for administrative needs, it's more like $70 ,000 per year.\n\nSo 20 million as a lump sum is not what we're receiving.\n\nIt's actually more like $700 ,000 per year and that shrinks over time.\n\n1 .1 seen in some reporting is inaccurate because again, 20 % of that goes to administrative management both from King County and the city of Seattle.\n\nAnd it doesn't begin to put a dent in the actual type of investments we need.\n\nI am very proud of our county for supporting the crisis care levy.\n\nWe know that that's the type of investments that are needed.\n\nI'm proud of this council for continuing to support programs like LEAD.\n\nI'm proud of the collective work that we've done with the executive over the past few years to scale up investments into LEAD and CoLEAD and REACH in the past.\n\nBut right now we're making policy decisions without knowing what the infrastructure for alternative pre -arrest diversions will look like.\n\nThat doesn't seem very wise when we already know that the outcome will be more people being arrested, more people who are black and brown, more people who are living unsheltered.\n\nAnd what the folks who are consuming outside need is access to services.\n\nThey are not at a point where they are making the cognitive decision to use outside because they are weighing the pros and the cons.\n\nThey are dealing with a public health crisis.\n\nThat is why they are consuming outside.\n\nAnd threatening people with arrest does not mean that more people will make the decision to not use outside.\n\nIt means that more people will get arrested without that pre -arrest diversion program stood up.\n\nI cannot support this program right now or this policy right now, especially not knowing that the pre -arrest diversion programs are going to be fully funded.\n\nI would like to see what the executive order looks like.\n\nI would like to see what the full budget looks like.\n\nAnd I would like those sideboards that we worked so hard to ensure that bias was taken out, to ensure that we were looking at public health data is put back in.\n\nAnd so that we can actually have a known directive on how this policy will be implemented.\n\nAgain, this is not a requirement that local jurisdictions codify what the state legislature has done.\n\nIt is already the law of the land, including in Seattle.\n\nIf we wanna do more to get people off the street who are consuming in public, we should be investing in those pre -arrest diversion programs.\n\nIt does not necessitate this legislation.\n\nIt does necessitate resources.\n\nSo I look forward to working with you all on ensuring that there's the actual resources to support pre -arrest diversion strategies, which does not have to compliment this legislation.\n\nAnd I will be voting no today with a hope to address the actual fundamental root cause of the problem that we're seeing, which is the public health crisis of addiction.\n\nThank you.\n\nI wanna thank you, Madam Chair, as well, and members of the central staff and Melanie Cray on my office because I appreciate the work that you put into the substitute and I don't wanna diminish all the hard work that you put into this, including the hard work that my team members have done.\n\nBut with some of the amendments made today and without seeing that funding, I'm not able to support it.\n\nThank you, Council Member Mosqueda.\n\nI spoke already to my staff in support for the bill of my intent to vote.\n\nYes.\n\nThe other co -sponsor, Council Member Lewis, did.\n\nI did not intend to make any closing remarks.\n\nI don't know if Council Member Lewis intends to make closing remarks.\n\nI did, after hearing your remarks, Council Member Mosqueda, I do feel the need to respond to one thing that you said.\n\nI know when we were discussing Amendment 6 and 7, I was speaking out loud my thought process about the change from will to may.\n\nActually, you characterized the impacts in a way that was consistent with what I was saying when we were discussing the amendment.\n\nBut after further consideration, after we voted on those amendments, I realized that the change of will to may does not undermine the direction of this legislation because the preference, the policy preference for diversion, both pre -arrest diversion and pre -booking diversion is described in many places throughout the bill.\n\nSo that is what is going to carry the day in the development of the policies.\n\nIt is not possible for the police department to finalize policies before we vote on this legislation.\n\nSo that is one reason why I think we haven't seen those policies.\n\nDepartment policies often derive from council legislation.\n\nAnd so it would not be possible for policies to be written in advance of the legislation because we don't know, the executive doesn't know what kind of amendments might be made to the legislation.\n\nSo that's just a little background on the sequencing of events and why it is that we'll be seeing those policies later.\n\nAs it relates to the budget commitments, there's not really a lot that we can do there given that the budget is going to be proposed very, very soon.\n\nI'm hoping that the executive is talking with providers and giving them early assurances of funding commitments that will be in the budget that we'll hear on the 26th.\n\nAnd I will be also looking forward to talking to both the executive and the provider community about how they intend to fulfill the commitments both in this ordinance as well as in the April executive order.\n\nAnd so with that, I would love it if the clerk called the roll on council bill 120645 as amended.\n\nCouncil member Mosqueda.\n\nNo.\n\nCouncil member Nelson.\n\nAye.\n\nCouncil member Peterson.\n\nYes.\n\nVice chair Lewis.\n\nYes.\n\nChair Herbold.\n\nYes.\n\nFour yes, one no.\n\nThank you, the motion carries and the committee recommendation that the bill pass as amended.\n\nWe'll go to, given that this was a split vote, our council rules say that unless there's agreement between the council president and the chair, the bill will be heard on September 26th.\n\nWe typically will skip a full council meeting in order to give other council members who are not on this committee the opportunity to familiarize themselves with why some people voted yes and some people voted no.\n\nThis expectation when there's a split vote is contained in our council rules, but there is a permissive ability to amend those rules if the council president and chair decide to do so.\n\nI will be discussing that, but otherwise our next regularly scheduled public safety and human services committee is scheduled for Tuesday, September 26th.\n\nThis will be the final meeting of this committee before council begins its budget deliberations.\n\nIf committee members anticipate being absent for that meeting in advance of the meeting, we ask that you let us know.\n\nAnd before we adjourn, unless I see other comments, seeing none, it is 12 .45 p .m. and we are adjourned.\n\nThank you everybody.",
